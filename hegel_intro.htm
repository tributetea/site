<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Ottilie 
  von Goethe, daughter-in-law of the famous poet and polymath, tells the following 
  story of an encounter between her sister and the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel in 
  the summer of 1827:</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>One day Goethe 
  announced... that there would be a guest for lunch without—as was always his 
  custom—revealing his name or introducing him as he made his appearance.... During 
  the meal Goethe was comparatively quiet—no doubt so as not to disturb the flowing 
  speech of his very voluble and logically penetrating guest. An entirely novel 
  terminology, a mode of expression mentally over-leaping itself, the peculiarly 
  employed philosophical formulations of this ever more animated man in the course 
  of his demonstrations—all this finally reduced Goethe to silence.... The lady 
  of the house likewise listened in silence—no doubt somewhat taken aback.... 
  After the meal had ended and the guest departed, Goethe asked... “Now how did 
  you like the man?”  “Strange,” she replied, “I cannot tell whether he is brilliant 
  or mad....” “Well, well, we just dined with the most famous of modern philosophers—Georg 
  Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel!” (Letters, p. 711)</i></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As Frau Goethe’s account suggests, a single 
  afternoon spent in the company of Prof. Hegel himself was hardly sufficient 
  to come away with any genuine understanding of what he said or thought; and, 
  as so many books which purport to be about his philosophy bear similar witness, 
  it seems equally possible for one to emerge from many years of study not much 
  better informed.</span></font></p>

'>If such a thing could</span> be measured, it would come as no surprise to learn 
  that the disparity between fame and comprehension is greater for Hegel than 
  for any other philosopher from Socrates to Wittgenstein. For various reasons—most 
  of them dubious—Hegel’s name is known far beyond the narrow confines of academic 
  philosophy; yet it is hard to find anyone with even the most basic grasp of 
  anything Hegel himself actually said.  </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As a result, the difference between the 
  Hegel of repute and the Hegel who emerges from his own words could not be more 
  dramatic. As Allen Wood suggests in a recent translation of Hegel’s <i>Philosophy 
  of Right</i>, this discrepancy is most likely due to the fact that</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'><i>Hegel is cited much more frequently than he is read, and discussed far oftener 
  than he is understood. Some of those who discourse on Hegel with the greatest 
  sophistication know him only through warped, inaccurate, or bowdlerized second-hand 
  accounts (for instance: accounts of the Hegelian dialectic as “thesis–antithesis–synthesis”). 
  The Hegelian ideas which capture the popular imagination are often not present 
  in Hegel at all, or have only the most tenuous and dubious connection with what 
  Hegel actually thought or wrote.</i></span><i> (EPR, p. xxvii)</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>[1]

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Elsewhere 
  Wood speaks of the subtleness and complexity of Hegel’s thought—from which, 
  he says, “his meaning can be separated only with skilled and careful surgery, 
  [and] even then usually not without risk of mortal injury.” </span><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>(<i>EPR</i>, p. xxvii)</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  As we shall see, the danger to which he refers is perhaps the greatest source 
  of error in trying to understand Hegel—that is, the attempt somehow to separate 
  the “meaning” or “essence” of his philosophy from his systematic presentation 
  of it (put simply: to extract the “content” from its “form”).</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent style='text-align:justify;
line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The 
  contrary approach of the present study takes its cue from Hegel himself, who 
  remarks in his introductory lecture on the philosophy of history: </span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'><i>Our ideas, or our intelligence generally, demands that the whole, the universal,

  it is only in this relation that they have their preeminent meaning and worth.</span> 
  (LPH, p. 53)</i></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For 
  Hegel, perhaps more than any other philosopher, it is necessary (if daunting) 
  to concern oneself first and foremost with the entire range of his thought before 
  focusing on any particular aspect of it. This approach is essential since, unlike 
  other philosophers, Hegel is unique in having essentially only <i>one</i> philosophy, 
  i.e., a single philosophical <i>system</i> rather than a multitude of diverse 
  and isolated “treatments”, e.g. of ethics, theology, logic, aesthetics, etc.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In 
  this system, for example, Hegel does not cut art off from religion, nor religion 
  from philosophy as such, and, by his own advice, we should resist the temptation 
  to do so ourselves—lest we fall into the same trap as those commentators who 
  attempt, in effect, to “saw off” some piece of Hegel’s system and then proceed 
  to criticize him on a point he would admit himself is incomprehensible severed 
  from its context and therefore, as he would say, “in abstraction”.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><i>People 
  often think they have done their job when they have found something which can 
  be justly criticized; they are right, of course, in one respect, but they are 
  wrong insofar as they fail to recognize the positive factor. To see only the 
  bad side in everything and to overlook all the positive and valuable qualities 
  is a sign of extreme superficiality. </i></span><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(LPWH, 
  p. 66)</span></i></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If 
  we are to avoid this superficiality and not only understand Hegel, but truly 
  engage with his thought, we can do no better than heed his own advice from the 
  end of the <i>Science of Logic</i>—where he says that in a genuine intellectual 
  confrontation, “[we] must penetrate opponent’s stronghold and meet him on his 
  own ground; [for] no advantage is gained by attacking him somewhere else and 
  defeating him where he is not.” <span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>(<i>SL</i>, p. 581)</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the case of so many books about 
  Hegel’s philosophy (especially in English) it is not hard to see that their 
  authors have taken what Hegel describes as the easy (and therefore inadequate) 
  route<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>[2]</span></a>: they pick and choose from the vast 
  range of his thought, criticizing what they take to be its negative element, 
  all without the slightest attempt to meet Hegel “on his own ground”. “[T]o look 
  for the substance and enduring value of things,” Hegel says in the <i>Philosophy 
  of History</i>, “is not so much equity as justice” <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>(<i>LPWH</i>,

<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In 
  <i>Hegelianism: The Path toward Dialectical Humanism</i>, a study of Hegel’s 
  influence on the philosophical world (and beyond), John Toews quotes the eulogies 
  of two Hegelian disciples, Friedrich Förster and Philipp Marheineke, who, in 
  praising their departed mentor, unwittingly predict the root causes of his decline 
  and fall from philosophical preeminence:</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><i>“Let 
  the dead bury the dead,” Förster proclaimed at Hegel’s grave-side; “to us belongs 
  the living; he who having thrown off his earthly chains celebrates his transfiguration.” 
  Marheineke also placed the burial of Hegel’s earthly remains in the context 
  of the immortal life of his spirit which [he said] “still lives and will live 
  forever in his writings and his countless admirers and students.” In fact, Marheineke 
  claimed that the departure of the empirical, individual Hegel allowed his eternal 
  spirit to be appropriated by his followers in “a purer fashion than before”. 
  “Emancipated from all sensuous appearance,” [he continued,] Hegel was now “no 
  longer susceptible to misinterpretation,” but [instead] “transfigured in the 
  hearts and spirits of all who recognized his eternal worth.”</i></span><i><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  (Toews, H, p. 88-9)</span></i></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We should not doubt that the “transfiguration” 
  which Marheineke predicted has taken place, though clearly his opinion concerning 
  the insusceptibility of Hegel’s thought to misinterpretation has proved false. 
  It is, in fact, Hegel’s “transfiguration” that is his philosophy’s appeal to 
  so many different individuals and schools of thought, which, far from guaranteeing 
  a lasting, coherent, and unified Hegel, has resulted in a widely divergent multiplicity 
  of Hegels (or better, “pseudo-Hegels”)—most of which, unfortunately, have little, 
  if anything to do with the Hegel who emerges from the serious consideration 
  of his writings and lectures taken on their own terms. It is these divergent 
  and conflicting Hegels which represent the greatest obstacle to achieving a 
  reasonable understanding of Hegel’s philosophy itself and its genuine value 
  to us today and our philosophical concerns.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span>[3] </span></a></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The origin of today’s motley band of Hegels 
  can be traced back as far as the publication of Hegel’s first book, the <i>Phenomenology 
  of Mind</i>, in 1807. In the Preface to this work, Hegel asserts his conviction 
  that “it is the nature of truth to prevail when its time has come, and that 
  it appears only when this time has come, and therefore never... prematurely, 
  nor finds a public not ready to receive it”</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  (<i>PM</i>, ¶71)</span><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>. There can be little doubt, however, that 
  far more people were bewildered than enlightened by the <i>Phenomenology</i>, 
  and, further, that the unfamiliarity and difficulty of its contents were responsible 
  for the wide range of interpretations of Hegel’s philosophy beginning with its 
  public debut.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With 
  Hegel’s death twenty-four years later, as suggested above, the philosophical 
  world’s Hegel population was able to multiply unchecked (i.e. “emancipated” 
  from the living proximity of the “empirical Hegel” himself). Thus it is no wonder—considering 
  the vastness and intricacy of his published books and lectures—that both conservatives 
  and revolutionaries as well as atheists and true believers alike have all acknowledged 
  themselves as his heirs through the glorification of various aspects of his 
  thought in isolation.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In addition to the multiplicity of interpretations 
  of Hegel, another point to note, particularly in relation to the English-speaking 
  tradition, concerns the unlikely appearance in 1857 of Hegel’s <i>Lectures on 
  the Philosophy of World History</i> as the first of his works to be translated 
  into English. In a recent edition of the first of these lectures, Duncan Forbes 
  notes that Hegel’s philosophy of history is often used as a “popular introduction” 
  to his philosophy as a whole, and that for this reason “one suspects that much 
  of the misunderstanding and misrepresentation of Hegel has been due to this 
  [fact].”</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> (<i>LPWH</i> [Nisbett trans.], p. vii)</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  Hegel’s philosophy of history does, in fact, contain the outline of his philosophy 
  in total, but this content is so “speculative” (to use Hegel’s term) that one 
  would have to have mastered the <i>Phenomenology of Mind</i>, the <i>Science 
  of Logic</i>, and probably the three-volume <i>Encyclopedia of the Philosophical 
  Sciences</i> as well before being able to recognize, let alone comprehend it.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The 
  point here is simply that many of the bizarrest notions about Hegel—that he 
  believed the universe to be a mind, that the natural world is “derived” from 
  or “posited” by thought, that humans are merely pawns of the “cunning of reason,” 
  etc.—all these may be attributed to attempts to approach him from the parts 
  of his philosophy which appear to be the most “accessible” or “concrete,” but 
  which, in fact, presuppose competence in its most speculative, and therefore 
  most complex and unfamiliar aspects.</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">From the publication of J.H. Stirling’s 
  influential <i>Secret of Hegel</i> in 1865 through Charles Taylor’s still-popular 
  <i>Hegel</i> of 1975, the old-fashioned (and unfounded) image of Hegel as grand 
  metaphysician has persisted in English-speaking philosophy virtually undisturbed 
  for nearly a century and a half.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span>[4] 
  </span></a></font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-weight:normal;
'>The “New” Hegel</span></font></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In 
  the introduction to his recent book, <i>Hegel’s Phenomenology: The Sociality 
  of Reason</i>, Terry Pinkard remarks:</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[A]fter 
  the Second World War... German commentators began crafting an original, precise, 
  and insightful interpretation of the Hegelian texts that can fairly be said 
  to have demolished (one hopes forever) most of the old myths about Hegel. In 
  the period from roughly 1979 to the present the seeds of that German debate 
  have begun to flower in the Anglo-American world as a whole host of new interpretations 
  of Hegel have been emerging that have taken that German scholarship... in new 
  directions.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'> (Pinkard, HP, p. 3)</span></i><a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span>[5] </span></a></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">These are significant points, indeed, 
  but it is possible to trace the emergence of the “new” (and much improved) Hegel 
  in Anglo-American philosophy back even further to the 1950s—especially in the 
  work of Walter Kaufmann (who, it is interesting to note, is much better known 
  for his commentaries and translations of Nietzsche than for his Hegel scholarship). 
  In his <i>Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary</i>, Kaufmann acknowledges 
  that many years of unfavorable concretion have taken their toll on Hegel’s philosophy 
  and he argues for the need to go back to the beginning and try, as far as possible, 
  to “start over”. Indeed, he does so himself by presenting what he describes 
  as an “intellectual biography” which investigates the origins of Hegel’s ideas 
  and charts the course of their development and maturity.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span>[6] 
  </span></a></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The 
  intention of the present study, however, is not to return to basics with Hegel, 
  at least not biographically speaking, but instead merely to acknowledge the 
  innovative example of a few ground-breaking scholars and recognize them as a 
  model for an open-minded and fair assessment of Hegel’s philosophy, particularly, 
  in the present case, his aesthetics. As we saw Hegel declare above, this approach 
  represents “not so much equity as justice.”</span></font></p>
<p style='text-align:justify;line-height:150%;
'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The 
  main point to grasp here, then, is that before we try to say something new about 
  Hegel—that is, engage critically and constructively with his philosophy—it is 
  imperative that we know what he himself said and understand what he meant. As 
  a first step toward familiarizing ourselves with Hegel in this way, we should 
  briefly introduce the two most important aspects of his philosophy: one to which 
  we have alluded already, which is “system”, and the other which is “spirit”—terms 
  which will be significant in the chapters ahead.</span></font></p>
<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-weight:normal;
'>Introducing </span><span style='font-size:14.0pt;
font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;'>“Geist”</span></font></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Throughout 
  his writings (and even in several of his book and lecture titles) Hegel employs 
  the word “<i>Geist</i>”—which may be translated as both “mind” and “spirit”. 
  Wielding Ockham’s razor, one might feel reluctant to use “spirit” in addition 
  to “mind” since this could be interpreted as deriving the existence of two entities 
  in English from a single German origin. Most people are wary enough of such 
  Hegelian creatures as “the Concept,” “Absolute Idea,” “Objective Mind,” and 
  so on, so one may legitimately wonder: Why add “Spirit” unnecessarily to this 
  cast of characters? Further consideration, however, reveals that there are certain 
  times when Hegel is clearly discussing far more than is ordinarily suggested 
  by the usage of “mind” alone. I have thus retained the option to employ either 
  “mind” or “spirit” for “<i>Geist</i>” in accordance with this principle. When 
  “spirit” does appear, then, it is intended to suggest that Hegel’s subject is 
  something greater than “mind”. What Hegel definitely should <i>not</i> be taken 
  to mean, however, is some thing <i>other</i> than mind. “Spirit” always has 
  <i>to do</i> with the mind, but it is clear that we must never construe it as 
  also being something <i>in addition</i> to mind. Hegel insists upon this point 
  often enough that we should take him at his word and refrain from making “spirit” 
  into the autonomous entity it is often purported to be.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To initiate a discussion of the distinctions 
  within <i>Geist</i>—i.e. between “spirit” and “mind”—we should consider the 
  following points: first, it bears repeating that Hegel’s “spirit” is not <i>a</i> 
  spirit, as in “holy spirit.” Instead, <i>Geist</i> is more akin to the broader 
  implications of something like “Christmas spirit”. Hegel’s own particular meanings 
  of “spirit” (and several are distinguishable) include: the spirit of the age, 
  national spirit, world-spirit, and so on. In the <i>Philosophy of History</i>, 
  for example, Hegel remarks: “spiritual totality constitutes a single being—the 
  spirit of a nation.”</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> (<i>LPWH</i>, p. 103)</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'> 
  What he means is that there is something which may be identified as national 
  spirit. (In the passage just quoted, Hegel is referring to the “English spirit”.) 
  Hegel, no more than anyone else, would want to go so far as to claim that there 
  is such a thing as the “English Spirit” existing somewhere independently of 
  the English nation or people. The same, of course, is true of his references 
  to “the spirit of mediaeval Europe,” the “oriental spirit,” just as it is of 
  the most comprehensive of Hegelian spirits: the “world-spirit”—by which Hegel 
  means the collection of national and temporal spirits considered as a whole. 
  This “universal spirit”, he says, “is essentially present as human consciousness. 
  Knowledge attains existence and being for itself in man. Spirit knows itself 
  and exists for itself as a subject, and… as such, it is equivalent to human 
  consciousness.”</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-weight:normal;
'>Scope of the Present Study</span></font></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If 
  we may say that the subject of Hegel’s philosophy is <i>spirit</i>, we may describe 
  its form as a <i>system</i>. In Chapter One, “A Circle of Circles”, we shall 
  properly consider the systematicity of Hegel’s philosophy, but it is necessary 
  here to make a few introductory remarks regarding system in general and its 
  role in determining the scope of the present study.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As noted above, Hegel’s body of philosophical 
  work is not simply an amalgam of books and lectures treating various subjects 
  in a philosophical manner; instead—being a system—it constitutes a unified conceptual 
  whole composed of separate yet related elements. Keeping in mind what has been 
  said so far about method and approach—especially Hegel’s own statements in this 
  regard—if we are to do our job well and consider Hegel’s philosophy fairly and 
  on its own terms, we must necessarily consider it in its entirety; for, as we 
  shall see, any attempt to treat some particular aspect of it—in the present 
  case: aesthetics—in isolation from the systematic philosophical whole of which 
  it is a part is doomed to failure.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Therefore, 
  as has already been suggested, Chapter One shall be concerned mainly with the 
  presentation and analysis of the systematic structure and significance of Hegel’s 
  philosophy as a whole, i.e. the groundwork upon which the major ideas of this 
  book will be based. The material of this chapter will be drawn from the following 
  texts: the <i>Phenomenology of Mind</i>, which lays the foundation for Hegel’s 
  system, the <i>Science of Logic</i> which demonstrates its logical basis and 
  structure, and the philosophical <i>Encyclopedia</i> which presents the Hegelian 
  system in outline.<a

<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter Two, “Beauty Born of the Spirit”,

  its relation to truth, freedom, nature, religion and so on.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Chapter Three, “A World of Actualized Beauty”, 
  continues the story from the point of view of Hegel’s historical division of 
  aesthetics into “art forms”—of which he identifies three: “symbolism”, “classicism”, 
  and “romanticism”. Following this review of the “practical” side of Hegel’s 
  aesthetics, Chapter Four, “Bowing the Knee No Longer ” will focus on the final—“romantic”—form 
  of art and scrutinize the details of the “end of art” associated with it.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span

  and discusses the possibilities of a constructive engagement with his ideas 
  and, further, a critical development of them in light of post-Hegelian art and 
  aesthetics.</span></font></p>

  Dimension”, it is hoped that the so-called “problem of ‘the end of art’” will 
  be laid to rest—allowing us to consider how, freed of this mythical burden, 
  space may be seen to be opened up in Hegel’s aesthetics for a rich and continuing 
  history—both artistically and philosophically.</span></font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In an Epilogue, “Obsessed with Originality,” 
  we part company with Hegel in order to consider the example of contemporary 
  Slovene artist Mojca Oblak’s “Transcendental Mannerism” and how it may be seen 
  to constitute a genuine contribution to the post-Hegelian history of art and 
  philosophy, and even human experience and cognition themselves.</span></font></p>

'>Concluding Introductory Remarks</span></font></h2>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:150%'><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It 
  may perhaps be true to say that ultimately this is not a book “about” Hegel 
  nor one which attempts to negotiate the body of Hegel scholarship and commentary 
  which has expanded rapidly in recent years, especially in the English-speaking 
  philosophical world.  Instead, this is a study which makes use of Hegel’s ideas—looking 
  into them and into his way of thinking in order to draw out their implications 
  and expand upon them. It does not, however, end up saying the same thing as 
  Hegel; nor does it refute him. We shall consider the same subject Hegel considers 
  in his aesthetics, and, in large part, we shall consider it in the same way. 
  Where we differ, however, is in our conclusions—not because we will conclude 
  something altogether different from Hegel... just slightly more.  Contrary to 
  received opinion, Hegel’s is a philosophy deeply rooted in history and closely 
  tied to real phenomena; and contrary also to his own references to his philosophy 
  as “speculative reason”, Hegel himself was no speculator in the modern sense. 
  Hegel was not interested (philosophically) in the future, nor will the future 
  concern us here. It is, of course, true that much that was future for Hegel 
  is now past for us; and much of what we will be considering in the more “constructive” 
  part of this book Hegel neither knew nor speculated upon, but now constitutes 
  the territory of our own reflection. Much has changed in the world and its cultural 
  productions since Hegel’s time, but his philosophy, as such, is not indifferent 
  to these products, and indeed, as we shall see, it continues to provide valuable 
  insights into them. This, then, is our project: not simply to try to guess what 
  Hegel might have said about Cubism or postmodern architecture, but to determine 
  what they and other artistic phenomena mean in the light of his philosophy, 
  and what—philosophically speaking—art itself is capable of achieving in response 
  to what Hegel calls “the needs of spirit”. It is my contention that we still 
  have much to learn, and my hope is that this book may be considered a contribution 
  to this continuing project.</font></p>

    example Wood alludes to perfectly illustrates this point since anyone who 
    claims to be even slightly acquainted with Hegel’s work believes the most 
    significant aspect of his philosophy is its “thesis–antithesis–synthesis” 
    structure. Unfortunately, however, this formula—though present in the writings 
    of Kant, Fichte, and Schelling—has little, if anything to do with Hegel himself, 
    as we shall see. The unfortunate implication, then, is that anyone who thinks 
    Hegel can be “explained” through this tripartite invocation either has not 
    read Hegel at all or has merely skimmed the surface of his philosophy so superficially 
    as to be susceptible to any line of “interpretation”, no matter how fanciful 
    and unfounded.</font></p>

    Hegel says: “Nothing is easier than to show up the negative element. We give 
    ourselves the satisfaction of mind in finding—when we recognize the negative 
    element—that we stand higher than what we are judging. This flatters our vanity. 
    To refute something is to be above it. [But] when we are away above something, 
    we have not worked our way into it. To find the affirmative, however, signifies 
    having worked our way into the thing and having justified it, and this is 
    far more difficult than refuting it. (LHP, p. 95)</font></p>

    is not hard to imagine in Hegel’s mouth Nietzsche’s famous words from the 
    opening of his philosophical autobiography Ecce Homo: “Do not, above all, 
    confound me with what I am not!” (Nietzche, EH, p. 33) Hegel himself approximates 
    this plea when he says: “An historian of philosophy must adhere strictly, 
    historically, precisely to the very own words of his author and not draw conclusions 
    from them and so make something different of them.” (LHP, p. 47)</font></p>

    of his most important translators and sensitive scholars, Malcolm Knox:</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'><i>The common idea that Hegel’s is a philosophy 
    of exceptional difficulty is quite mistaken. Once his terminology is understood 
    and his main principles grasped he presents far less difficulty than Kant, 
    for example. One reason for this is a certain air of dogmatism [in Kant]: 
    Kant’s statements are often hedged around with qualifications; but Hegel had, 
    as it were, seen a vision of absolute truth and he expounds it with confidence.</i></span><i><span

    earlier than Kaufmann’s book, we should note the publication (in English) 
    of Herbert Marcuse’s Reason and Revolution (1941) with its wide-ranging discussions 
    of Hegel’s early, pre-Phenomenology manuscripts—most of which were not considered 
    worthy of translation until the mid-1980s (presumably because they did not 
    seem relevant to the Hegel already consolidated in English-speaking philosophy).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Knox translated some earlier works 
    as Hegel’s Early Theological Essays shortly after the appearance of Reason 
    and Revolution, but it has not been until recently that the official Hegel-Archiv 
    in Bochum has released scholarly editions of Hegel’s writings predating the 
    Phenomenology which have thus enabled us to witness first hand his transformation 
    from young Christian theologian to mature philosopher of logic and system.</font></p>

    thought which do not receive detailed treatment here are: the philosophy of 
    religion (mainly because well over half of Hegel’s aesthetics concerns art’s 
    links with religion and theology), his well-known text-book the Philosophy 
    of Right (whose subject-matter of ethics, law, political theory, etc. exceeds 
    the scope of the present study), and finally the philosophy of nature—whose 
    systematization of early 19th century physical, chemical, and biological science 
    does not concern us here.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"></font></p>
