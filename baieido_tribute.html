    The history (or prehistory, we should say) of incense stretches farther back in time than any human civilization.           Indeed, it can be said to be as old as fire itself. The burning of fragrant woods such as cedar, pine and cypress, and aromatic resins, roots, berries and other natural materials constitutes the true origin of incense. As these and other special substances were singled out and their unique properties distilled, the conscious practice of incense was born. Therefore, incense is many things to many people.<br><br><img alt="Incense" src="/tea_school/koh.gif"><br><font color="#999999" size="-1">KOU - Japanese character for 'incense'</font><br><br>

A Tribute Incense embodies the highest meanings of this word and implies quality and purity. Incense has been used around the world with varying results and goals. We focus on the incense produced by China and Japan for ritual and art. The incense we offer is made with few artificial colors or ingredients (and in most cases none!).
