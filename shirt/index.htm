<p>I wanted the 338 design, but I was told it would not look like the picture 
    on your website that I liked, so I changed to 343.<br>
    I was sent this picture for the back:<br>
    <img src="shirt1.jpg" width="600" height="400"> </p>
  <p>but I want it to look like this:<br>
    <img src="shirt2.jpg" width="600" height="400"></p>
  <p>My usual shirt size is Medium-Long.<br>
    41 inches around should be good.<br>
    Thanks,<br>
    -Justin</p>
