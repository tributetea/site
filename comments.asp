          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thanks for the very 
          professional service and your kindness in ensuring that my order would 
          arrive as quickly as possible. Much appreciated.<br>
          - Lillian A., Springfield, VA </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to tell you how pleased 
          I am with my order. It arrived in excellent time, in excellent condition, 
          and the shipping cost was lower than I had anticipated. Good customer 
          service is getting harder and harder to come by, so I just wanted to 
          tell you how happy I am with your company and the service you provided 
          and I won't hesitate to recommend you to all my friends. <br>
          Thanks again - your fast and friendly service is very much appreciated.<br>
          Nancy G., Red Bluff, CA</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just wanted to let you 
          know how pleased I am with the teapot. It was shipped so fast.<br>
          The sample of jasmine tea was excellent.<br>
          - Jen S., Chicago, IL</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Order arrived 2 days+1 morning 
          after order! (You must've shipped it on the the same day I ordered.) 
          Thank you for your prompt service. Loved the cup so much that I o.d.'d 
          on caffeine that day--really neat. And the Phoenix Oolong is wonderful. 
          AND I've never tasted a Jasmine Green quite so good as the sample you 
          sent. Usually turn my nose up at the stuff they sell in restaurants--say 
          &quot;no jasmine--bring oolong.&quot; The quality of your sample isn't 
          even in the same league. I'll have to place an order and just carry 
          it with me, which I am doing more and more frequently. After tasting 
          &quot;good-quality&quot; tea, one is ruined for the other stuff. Really 
          appreciate the quality of your tea, the prompt service, AND for checking 
          up on me.<br>
          (And thanks so much for the sample of Jasmine Pearl Green.)<br>
          - Martha S., Dallas, TX</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The teapot arrived in less 
          than four days. It is beautiful - a great product that I learned about 
          at Pommodoro, a great little bistro in West Stockbridge, Massachusetts. 
          Good promotion and great service.<br>
          - Phyllis T., New York, NY</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you for confirming 
          my order and for the shipping upgrade to Priority Mail... I especially 
          appreciate this &quot;gift&quot; as I had hoped to surprise two special 
          people with these items for Christmas! I'm also looking forward to trying 
          your sample of Jasmine Pearl tea. My husband and I both enjoy tea.<br>
          It's been a pleasure doing business with you!<br>
          - Vickie N., Dalton, MA</font></p>
        <p>Thank you so much. It seems these days in most businesses that customer 
          service is optional and I feel your company went out of its way to provide 
          me with EXCELLENT customer service. Just by getting a call yesterday 
          because the color I wanted was not in, upgrade in shipping, sample of 
          tea, makes a great difference. I will definitely be ordering from your 
          company again in the future, for my personal use, gifts, etc. I will 
          also share my experience with others, in the hopes that they too will 
          use your web site.<br>
          - Jody S., North Arlington, NJ</p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thank you! The tea canister 
          arrived in perfect condition, and it's exactly what I've been looking 
          for. I truly appreciate your super quick service and the tea sample. 
          I'm keeping your web site in my list of &quot;Favorites&quot;. I'll 
          be back.<br>
          - Paul B., Birmingham, AL</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am enjoying my teapot very 
          much and it has been much better than I had anticipated. I collect a 
          lot of expensive tea pots and thought it might be wise to find one that 
          would be practical for everyday use...<br>
          Thank you very much for the jasmine tea and doing you best to get it 
          here on time.<br>
          I look forward to ordering from you again soon.<br>
          - Alex A., Ann Arbor, MI</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Eeeeegaaaads!!!!! THANK YOU 
          for the Wonderful service!!!!!!<br>
          I placed an order on the internet Saturday or Sunday and I come home 
          from work on Wednesday and its already waiting at my front door! Thank 
          you for the Wonderful service!!<br>
          - Laurie W., Encinitas, CA</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I want to thank you for the 
          prompt delivery of my order. The teapot is beautiful. I have been looking 
          for something that is well designed and aesthetically pleasing for a 
          while and I am happy to have found it with Tribute Tea. I live in Manhattan 
          and most things are available in the stores but I have never seen this 
          item for sale. I did use it in a cafe though and that's what attracted 
          me to it. I am British and have lived here for 12 years, and am happy 
          to finally have a good teapot in which to make my daily tea!<br>
          Keep up the good work!<br>
          - Amanda A., New York, NY </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just wanted to... thank 
          you for your timely response and courteous manner. I was truly impressed 
          and, due to this and due to the quality of the products that I did enjoy, 
          I will DEFINITELY be doing business with you again in the future, and 
          will recommend you to my tea-drinking friends for your service. <br>

          and you certainly have a future customer in me. I appreciate the thorough 
          communication, shipping upgrade and orange spice tea sample (which was 
          delicious in my orange teapot, by the way).<br>
          Thanks, again, for such a pleasant transaction!<br>
