  the End of Art</font></h3>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
  <font size="+2">I.1. ‘A CIRCLE OF CIRCLES’<br>
  </font>The Science and System of Hegel's Philosophy</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">INTRODUCTION</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When it was published in Edinburgh 
  in 1865, J.H. Stirling's enormous two-volume Secret of Hegel was the first full-length 
  study of the German philosopher in English. Shortly afterwards, a joke—still 
  circulating amongst Hegelians—arose to the effect that if Prof. Stirling indeed 
  knew ‘the secret of Hegel’, for some reason he seems to have kept it to himself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In conjunction with this witticism 
  it is interesting to note that in a letter to his friend and colleague Friedrich 
  Niethammer, Hegel himself says that ‘the things one most easily keeps secret 
  are those about which there is nothing at all to be known.’ And while lecturing 
  on fine art he remarked: ‘[W]hat is supreme and most excellent is not, as might 
  be supposed, the inexpressible.’</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The point in juxtaposing the above 
  joke and remarks from Hegel himself is not -like Stirling- to suggest that Hegel's 
  philosophy in fact constitutes some sort of ‘secret’, nor is it to use Hegel's 
  own words against him—suggesting that the secret of his philosophy has kept 
  so long simply because there is nothing behind it to discover. Instead, the 
  presupposition of the present study is not only that Hegel does have a genuine, 
  significant (and, indeed, valid) philosophical position, but also that, as an 
  educator as well as a highly original thinker, he was particularly concerned 
  to make it comprehensible and thus accessible to others. In the preface to the 
  Phenomenology of Mind he declares: ‘the individual has a right to demand that 
  science should at least provide him with the ladder to this standpoint’ (that 
  is, to science itself), and further that philosophy ‘should show him this standpoint 
  within himself.’ Far from shutting itself up in an ivory tower, then, Hegel 
  believes on the contrary, not that philosophy should lower itself, but that 
  it should reach down from its heights to lift us up to genuine knowledge—as 
  he says: ‘to this ether’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we discussed in the Introduction, 
  the subject of Hegel's philosophy is spirit- specifically the comprehension 
  of its origins, history, and logical structure- the full understanding of which 
  he calls 'absolute knowing'. As the goal of Hegel's philosophy as a whole, as 
  we shall see, 'absolute knowing' is philosophical knowledge which reconciles 
  the divisions of thought created by the mind on its path toward spirit (i.e. 
  between thought itself and its object, self and other, ideal and real, universal 
  and particular, etc.).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Until quite recently (and especially 
  in the 'analytic' tradition of philosophy), it has been an almost universal 
  rule to presuppose the general untenability -if not outright absurdity- of Hegel's 
  philosophy. In his influential and still popular Hegel of 1975, for example, 
  Charles Taylor accepts as given the 'fact' that the Hegelian system is 'quite 
  dead'- declaring that 'no one can believe Hegel's ontology- namely that the 
  Universe is Spirit positing itself as a matter of rational necessity.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: More colourfully we find Arthur 
  Schopenhauer remarking in 1859 in The World as Will and Representation that 
  &quot;the greatest effrontery in serving up sheer nonsense, in scrabbling together 
  senseless and maddening webs of words, such as had previously been heard only 
  in madhouses, finally appeared in Hegel. It became the instrument of the most 
  ponderous and general mystification that has ever existed, with a result that 
  will seem incredible to posterity, and be a lasting monument of German stupidity.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even as late as 1984, Stephen Bungay 
  was still aware enough of the persistence of this sort of attitude toward Hegel 
  that he was able to open his study of Hegel’s aesthetics, Beauty and Truth, 
  with the statement: 'Nobody really knows for sure what Hegel wanted to do, let 
  alone whether he actually managed to do it or not.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Hegel's own time there was clearly 
  some confusion as to what he meant by 'absolute'- i.e. 'absolute idea', 'absolute 
  mind', and, of course, 'absolute knowing' itself. In the second part of his 
  Encyclopedia -the Philosophy of Nature- he alludes to an encounter he once had 
  with the then-well-known Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Krug (Kant's successor 
  as Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in Konigsberg). Hegel remarks in the Philosophy 
  of Nature: 'Herr Krug once requested... that the philosophy of nature should 
  perform the trick of deducing merely his writing pen.' Hegel's point is to demonstrate 
  the error of Prof. Krug [and other critics (then and now)] in believing that 
  the test of an 'absolute' philosophy is whether or not it can logically account 
  for absolutely everything- i.e. from the concepts of thought to space and time 
  and the world we live in right down to the very pen with which Herr Krug composed 
  his criticisms. But this 'trick' is clearly not the aim of his (or anyone else's) 
  philosophy rightly so-called.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A useful distinction which goes 
  a long way towards clarifying the ambiguity of Hegel's claims about 'the absolute' 
  is made by Martin Heidegger in his illuminating lectures on Hegel's Phenomenology. 
  In a sub-section of a discussion called 'Hegel's Conception of a System of Science' 
  entitled 'Absolute and Relative Knowledge', Heidegger asks: 'What does &quot;absolute 
  knowledge&quot; mean?' He answers himself: 'The term &quot;absolute&quot; means 
  initially &quot;not relative&quot;... Relative knowledge is that which does 
  not know everything there is to know.' In other words: 'relative knowing' knows 
  this thing and not that, some things and not others. To be 'absolute', then, 
  in this 'initial' sense, Heidegger says, would 'be quantitatively absolute since 
  it would mean knowing everything there is to know.' Heidegger's distinction, 
  however, is, as he says, that 'for Hegel the concepts of relative and absolute, 
  as characters of knowledge, are to be understood not quantitatively but qualitatively.' 
  Thus, as Heidegger suggests, the way we should think of Hegel's 'absolute' is 
  as a way of thinking, i.e. the way of thinking 'absolutely', rather than what 
  or how much is being thought about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To continue along the lines of Heidegger's 
  discussion we can imagine a day when scientists will know enough about the micro-biology 
  of cells to cure and eradicate cancer, or when meteorologists will understand 
  the variables and interactions of the earth's temperature, humidity, and so 
  on to such an extent that they will be able to say exactly what the weather 
  will be in a month, a week (or even just tomorrow). But these and other 'physical' 
  sciences constitute only quantitative forms of knowledge; they are concerned 
  with mere 'fact-finding', and, as such, can be concluded only when all of the 
  relevant facts have been found. The “philosophical science” in which Hegel is 
  engaged, however, represents an altogether different pursuit of knowledge. Hegel 
  does not set out to know more and more about the world until he believes he 
  has acquired all the knowledge there is to be had. Instead, he sets out to know 
  more and more about knowing itself- that is, to determine just what our relation 
  to the world (and thinking itself) is- what we know and how we know it. It is 
  in this way that Hegel hopes to get beyond an epistemological investigation 
  to an ontological one- i.e. to provide a comprehensive (i.e. 'absolute') account 
  of what being itself is, rather than precisely what (and how much) is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This blurring of philosophy's traditional 
  epistemological/ontological distinction (characterized by one commentator as 
  Hegel's 'epistemological realism') arises from Hegel's reconsideration of questions 
  about being as questions about the structures and forms of human experience 
  (i.e. consciousness and the development of thought)- for it is through being 
  conscious of (i.e. knowing) the world that we are conscious at all, and it is 
  this consciousness (of the world and of ourselves knowing it) which defines 
  our being itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If we take this and the above points 
  about the 'absolute' and 'knowing', then what at first seems to be a 'secret' 
  which Hegel is reluctant to divulge (or worse- the senseless 'scrabbling' of 
  a lunatic) turns out to be only our own reluctance to take Hegel at his word 
  and consider his philosophy on its own terms- that is, as a system of thought, 
  as we shall undertake now.</font></p>
<hr width="75%">
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A system is a collection of diverse 
  elements bound together by a common purpose or unifying principle. To say that 
  Hegel's philosophy is a system, however, signifies more than this, and, in fact, 
  allies him with Kant, who, in the Critique of Pure Reason, defines a system 
  as 'the unity of manifold cognitions under an idea. This idea is the rational 
  concept of the form of the whole in so far as the concept determines a priori 
  both the scope of the whole and the place of the parts in relation to each other'. 
  The Hegelian philosophy can be said to be in general agreement with Kant's definition 
  (aside from his stipulation that the scope and parts/whole relation be determined 
  in advance). As we shall see below, all Hegel presupposes in developing his 
  philosophical system is the need to be systematic (i.e. rather than what such 
  a system will contain and how it will be organized). As such, Hegel's philosophy 
  is no mere aggregate of externally related topics -like a collection of text-books 
  on a shelf- but instead results from seeing all its parts as necessary components 
  inhering in and constituting a single, universal (i.e. 'absolute') whole. ('The 
  true is the whole', Hegel says.) In the History of Philosophy we read: 'the 
  real meaning of &quot;system&quot; is totality, and only as such is a system 
  true- a totality beginning from what is simplest and becoming ever more concrete 
  as it develops.' It is because of this comprehensive 'absolute' systematicity 
  that Hegel regards philosophy (particularly his own) as 'scientific' or 'science 
  itself'. Reciprocally he says: 'Unless it is a system, philosophy is not a scientific 
  production.' What makes philosophy science is the way it is pursued, and the 
  employment of scientific method reveals philosophy to be a system.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is Kant's critique of reason, 
  Hegel says, which 'constitutes the base and the starting-point of recent German 
  philosophy', but, while a self-proclaimed admirer of Kant, Hegel clearly does 
  not accept Kant's own high opinion of his critical philosophy- that is, that 
  it</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>must remain confident of its 
  irresistible propensity to satisfy the theoretical as well as the moral, practical 
  purposes of reason- confident that no change of opinions, no touching up or 
  reconstruction into some other form is in store for it; the system of the Critique 
  rests on a fully secured foundation, established for ever; it will be indispensable, 
  too, for the noblest ends of mankind in all future ages.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In spite of his professed admiration 
  and in view of the scope and magnitude of his own plans for philosophy, it is 
  clear that Hegel believed Kant had over-estimated the invincibility of his critique 
  of reason. The critical philosophy certainly established great advances in thought, 
  but to Hegel, Kant had merely laid the ground-work -'the base and starting-point'- 
  for what we shall see was to become his own 'reconstruction' of philosophy. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this opening chapter, then, as 
  a study of the basis and development of the 'totality' of Hegel's system, we 
  shall see that philosophy's own immanent 'dialectic' unfolds itself into a system 
  which takes the shape of a circle- the form, Hegel says, which the content of 
  philosophy gives to itself. Along the path of this circle the individual parts 
  of philosophy find their proper places and relations to each other and the system 
  as a whole. Each is what Hegel calls its own 'circle'- encompassing even smaller, 
  more particular circles, and is itself encompassed by the all-encompassing circle 
  of the system as a whole- which, in this way -as a 'circle of circles'- may 
  be regarded as a 'system of systems'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In Part One below, then, we shall 
  see from Hegel's insistence that it be systematic, precisely what he thinks 
  philosophy is and how it should be produced and presented. We should note here 
  that since Hegel does not regard philosophy as merely one area of enquiry amongst 
  others, but rather, as we have already seen, as 'science itself', it cannot 
  begin simply by making arbitrary assumptions about its subject-matter and the 
  course its study will take. Philosophy, Hegel believes, is not an activity which 
  conforms to the wishes of the philosopher, but is instead a process which develops 
  according to its own immanent logic. To understand what this means we will first 
  have to trace our way back to the origins of the 'philosophical point of view' 
  out of which philosophy proper arises. Our first section, then, will be devoted 
  to a detailed consideration of Hegel's first, and arguably most important work: 
  The Phenomenology of Mind—which he explicitly intended to serve as the ground-work 
  of his systematic philosophy. Accordingly, it is here that he first sets out 
  to identify the problems of philosophy and the form his approach to their solution 
  will take.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">After having thus acquainted ourselves 
  with Hegel's philosophical project and his first, phenomenological consideration 
  of it, we will be prepared to make the transition to Part Two- in which we will 
  see how he builds upon the results of the Phenomenology's conclusion in the 
  'concept of philosophy' (i.e. 'absolute knowing'). Hegel develops this 'Concept' 
  in his second major work: The Science of Logic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At this transitional point logic's 
  'dialectic of thought' takes over from phenomenology's 'dialectic of consciousness'—leading 
  us, as we shall see, not only away from logic's starting point—which represents 
  the beginning of philosophy as such—but also returning us back to this origin 
  as philosophy's conclusion. This is possible only because, as we have already 
  seen, the line along which Hegel's philosophy progresses is one which is reflected 
  back upon itself and thus closes to form a circle. The details and significance 
  of this process (as well as the meaning of the circle) will be discussed below 
  in an analysis of the structure and development of Hegel's logic and his system 
  in general, and their unique inter-relation of form and content.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">PART ONE</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In October 1807, Gobhardt's bookstore 
  in Bamberg issued an advance notice of the following item: 'G.W.F. Hegel's System 
  of Science. Volume One, containing The Phenomenology of Mind'. This book, the 
  notice continues, will consider 'the becoming of knowledge' and thus constitutes 
  what we could call a 'history' of consciousness. The premise of the Phenomenology, 
  then, is that thinking itself has a history, and more than that- the object 
  of thought as well, as we shall see.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel is alluding to in his 
  characterization of the Phenomenology as the 'becoming of knowledge' is its 
  goal- 'absolute knowing'. Our characterization of the Phenomenology as a 'history 
  of consciousness' is meant to focus our attention on the leading up to this 
  goal- that is, on the actual process of knowing's becoming. In this light it 
  is instructive to focus upon the second half of Hegel's title- that which we 
  are considering the phenomenology of, which is mind- thus suggesting that it 
  is thinking -or more precisely thought's own immanent development which does 
  the leading up to 'absolute knowing'. To tell the story of this development, 
  then, is to recount the history of consciousness- which is what Hegel sets out 
  to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The other half of the Phenomenology 
  's title -'phenomenology' itself- tells us how Hegel proposes to investigate 
  this history- that is, how knowing becomes- which is through observation of 
  the development of experience, or, we could say, the drama of the mind's encounter 
  with otherness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Simply as 'phenomenology' Hegel's 
  project is not new; for throughout philosophical history philosophers have begun 
  with internal experience and proceeded outwards to ask: 'What is there?' (i.e. 
  the basic question of metaphysics). The problem, though, is that whenever we 
  try to determine what is out there it seems as if we are limited in what we 
  can know to only that which we can take in; that is, we can never know what 
  the world is really like, but only what it is like for us- our perception of 
  it. From Plato to Hume, all philosophy could do in its quest for knowledge was 
  retreat from the world it sought to know- affirming its existence somewhere 
  'out there', and thus inaccessible to our minds 'in here'. This classical problem 
  of philosophy -touching both ontological and epistemological issues- is precisely 
  what Hegel discusses in the opening lines of his Introduction to the Phenomenology 
  where he says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is a natural assumption that 
  in philosophy, before we start to deal with its proper subject-matter- that 
  is, the actual cognition of what truly is, one must first of all come to an 
  understanding about cognition [itself]- which is regarded either as an instrument 
  to get hold of the absolute, or as a medium through which one discovers it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel is here referring not only 
  to Kant's critical idealism [that is, his critique of reason (and with it metaphysics)], 
  but also to the standpoint of the empiricists (such as Locke and Hume) who disbelieved 
  in the possibility of knowing anything with certainty apart from the sensory 
  contents of experience. In his Preface to the Science of Logic Hegel says that 
  according to this attitude 'we place our thoughts as a medium between ourselves 
  and the objects, and that this &quot;medium&quot;, instead of connecting us 
  with the objects, rather cuts us off from them.' In a letter Hegel refers to 
  this idea as the 'hypochondriacal German view that renders everything objective 
  in vain, and then only savours itself in this vanity.' In the Phenomenology 
  he calls this 'the fear of falling into error', and says that it 'sets up a 
  mistrust of science'. 'It is hard to see why we should not turn around and mistrust 
  this very mistrust. Should we not be concerned as to whether this fear of error 
  is not just the error itself?' Similarly, in the History of Philosophy, Hegel 
  remarks:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[I]t is said that we must know 
  the faculty of knowing before we can know; for to investigate the faculties 
  of knowledge means to know them. But how we are to know without knowing... to 
  apprehend the truth before the truth, it is impossible to say. It is just the 
  old story of the philosopher who would not go into the water until he could 
  swim. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's point is that assuming cognition 
  to be a mere instrument or medium somehow externally related to its objects 
  takes a great deal for granted- namely, he says, 'that there is a difference 
  between ourselves and this cognition. Above all, it presupposes that the absolute 
  stands on one side and cognition on the other', while Hegel's point is that 
  the skeptical-empiricist approach which 'calls itself &quot;fear of error&quot;, 
  reveals itself rather as fear of the truth.' [In fact, at the opening of the 
  Phenomenology's Preface, Hegel says that such attempts to 'introduce' and qualify 
  (i.e. hedge) philosophy are 'not only superfluous, but in view of the subject-matter, 
  even inappropriate and misleading.'] The only way to learn to swim, in other 
  words, is to enter the river. If we want to find the truth we must follow Hegel 
  and leap directly into experience and thought- that is, into the Phenomenology 
  itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: We should note here that in 
  Hegel's day the opposite (and cultishly popular) approach to the insatiable 
  skepticism of empiricism was a school of thought called 'intuitionism' which 
  held that reality or 'the absolute' could simply be immediately and non-rationally 
  'intuited' or felt. This view stemmed from the combined influences of the early 
  17th century German mystic Jakob B”hme, the 'monism' of Spinoza (1632-77), and 
  the 'romanticism' of Rousseau. Though much criticized and even lampooned by 
  Hegel (especially in the Phenomenology's Preface), this 'unscientific' (and 
  therefore, as far as Hegel was concerned, unphilosophical) style of philosophy 
  lived on throughout his life and returned to prominence after his death in the 
  teaching of his former friend Friedrich Schelling (who outlived him by 23 years)- 
  and found its true heir ultimately in the 'existentialist' theology of S&iacute;ren 
  Kierkegaard (1813-55).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To return to our main discussion 
  and in particular to Kant: the presupposition of his philosophy is that the 
  mind is a medium. He affirmed the empiricists' belief in the insurmountable 
  gulf between thought and its object, and therefore the impossibility of genuine 
  knowledge as well. His self-proclaimed 'revolutionary' response, however, was 
  not to remain content with skepticism, but instead to shift the entire enterprise 
  of enquiry away from trying to know the world outside us to scrutinizing the 
  inner realm of reason itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: Over a hundred years earlier, 
  Descartes in his Meditations of 1641, had attempted a similar project with his 
  famous cogito argument- concluding that in his quest for certainty, although 
  he could doubt the truth of all the experience and facts of his life, there 
  remained one thing of which he could be genuinely certain- which, of course, 
  was his doubt itself- that is, his own thinking. Hence Descartes' famous deduction: 
  'I think, therefore I am' ('Cogito ergo sum') -perhaps the best-known quotation 
  in all of philosophy. The implications of this statement with the 'first-person 
  twist' it puts on the classical problem of knowledge garnered for Descartes 
  the popular title: 'father of modern philosophy'. Yet, as we shall see below, 
  it remained for Kant to apotheosize this idea in his first Critique since Descartes 
  himself was unable to re-emerge from his skeptical hermeneutic without dubiously 
  positing a material body to go along with his theoretically non-spatial thinking 
  mind, and even more dubiously- a benevolent deity to coordinate their inter-action.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kant's 'critical' project -including 
  his famous 'transcendental deduction' of the categories he believed to be necessary 
  for us to experience or cognize anything- constitutes his 'Copernican Revolution'- 
  named in reference to the Polish astronomer Nikolaj Kopernik who in the 16th 
  century realized that the revolution we perceive of heavenly bodies around us 
  is in reality an illusion produced by our own motion on a rotating earth (which 
  itself revolves around a star). Similarly to Copernicus Kant redirected the 
  focus of philosophy from questions about the world to questions about our consciousness 
  of it. From now on the major problem for philosophers was no longer 'What is 
  there?', but instead: 'How do we know what is?'- a shift which constitutes the 
  substance of Kant's 'critique of reason'. His point, however, is not that we 
  cannot know anything -i.e. that metaphysics is futile- but that since -as he 
  believes his transcendental deduction shows- our thought must have the particular 
  structure it does in order for the world to appear the way it does, then that 
  structure (of our minds) must also be the structure of reality itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Two things should be apparent from 
  this brief consideration of Kant's philosophy: its great advance and its great 
  disappointment; for Kant says we can know the truth about the world, but unfortunately 
  it is only the truth for us- that is, the world as mediated through the 'categories' 
  of our thought, while the world as it is in itself remains forever beyond our 
  comprehension. Thus arises Kant's famous 'thing-in-itself'- with which he comprehensively 
  divided the world into two substances: phenomena and 'noumena'- i.e. the world 
  for us and the world for (or in) itself. Hegel criticizes this position by saying 
  that in the end 'Kant fell back again into the fixed opposition between subjective 
  thinking and objective things.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It was the untidy and understandably 
  undesirable persistence of Kant's unknowable 'noumenal' realm -both out in the 
  world and deep in the structure of our minds- which set the agenda for the next 
  generation of philosophers -the 'absolute (as opposed to 'transcendental') idealists': 
  namely how to reconcile these seemingly disparate worlds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814), 
  in his attempt to 'systematize' Kant's critical philosophy (as he proclaimed 
  his goal to be), began not with something as ambiguous and unstable as the relation 
  we characterized above as between 'inside' and 'outside' -that is, thought and 
  being, self and other- but instead with what he regarded as fundamental, unchanging, 
  and irrefutable: the relation of the self to itself- self-consciousness, or 
  the famous 'I=I' which is at the center of his philosophy and from which, he 
  believed, all experience stems.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel, however, regarded this grounding 
  of everything in self-consciousness as unsatisfactory because the relation of 
  the self to itself provides no more stable or fundamental a basis for philosophical 
  enquiry than that of the self to its other. Fichte's point (like Descartes') 
  is that in order to know what the world is really like, we must begin from a 
  ground which is absolutely certain. What is absolutely certain for Fichte (again, 
  similarly to Descartes) is that 'I=I', or that our consciousness of anything 
  else has our consciousness of ourselves as its origin. From this starting point 
  -which he calls the 'Absolute Ego'- Fichte proceeds to argue that the rest of 
  the world can be accounted for as what the self posits as the 'not-self'. In 
  other words Fichte takes Kant's 'Copernican Revolution' to the extreme in that 
  he argues that it is not just the mind which gives the world the structure it 
  has; it is the mind which produces ('posits') that world (a notion often erroneously 
  attributed to Hegel). Therefore, in response to the Kantian inscrutability of 
  noumena, Fichte's self -in knowing itself- is able also to know the world since 
  the world is its own creation. In other words: from the simple intellectual 
  intuition of oneself, all true knowledge logically and systematically proceeds; 
  everything else that we know is simply a consequence of our original self-knowing 
  and is to be 'deduced' from it and organized into a system of philosophy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we shall see shortly, Hegel's 
  strategy was to follow Fichte's lead in recognizing both the need to go beyond 
  Kant and the necessity for philosophy -in order to be genuinely 'absolute' or 
  all-inclusive- to be systematic. Hegel's solution to these and other problems 
  of idealism ultimately took the form of his mature tri-partite system- outlined 
  in the three volumes of his Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before proceeding to the main focus 
  of this section -which is Hegel's phenomenology- we may summarize the material 
  covered so far in three specific points: </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(1) Kant inaugurates his 'Copernican 
  Revolution' with the Critique of Pure Reason and effectively redirects the focus 
  of western philosophy from gazing out upon the world to gazing back upon ourselves 
  and the workings of thought itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(2) Fichte radicalizes this revolution 
  by rejecting Kant's residual dualism of self and transcendent world mediated 
  by 'categories' in favour of retaining the self alone as 'Absolute Ego'. He 
  jettisons also the thing-in-itself and affirms only the reality of the 'ego' 
  and the world it projects.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(3) Finally, Hegel inherits from 
  Fichte his critical stance towards Kantianism and his recognition of the need 
  for comprehensive systematicity. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel cannot accept, however, 
  is how far Fichte feels obliged to venture in search of philosophical certainty 
  and genuine knowledge- i.e. all the way into the deepest subjectivity of 'I=I'. 
  It was this ego -as the identity of the self with itself in self-consciousness- 
  which Fichte regarded as the soundest basis upon which to construct a philosophical 
  system. To Hegel, this project was problematic in at least two ways- which once 
  we have understood them will reveal the real issues which he explicitly set 
  out to address in his own philosophical project, and which will thus also provide 
  us with a spring-board into the Phenomenology- where he first and most ambitiously 
  set out to solve them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In short: the major philosophical 
  problem of the day -explicitly left-over from Fichte and his response to Kant- 
  was two-fold: first, his view of the self as independent and self-contained, 
  and second, the implications of this independence for the real task of philosophy- 
  which is not to split the self from its world (as Kant did), nor merely to relate 
  it to itself (as in Fichte), but, instead, (as Schelling attempted again and 
  again) to unify the self with its world in a concrete and determinate way by 
  recognizing that, in fact, they are not distinct- or that they are distinct, 
  but not separate or separable, i.e. that each is constituative of the other.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The point of philosophy, then, as 
  Hegel announces it in his first published essay in 1801 -'The Difference Between 
  Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy'- is not to demonstrate (or assume) 
  that self and world are distinct entities (or 'substances') and then to argue 
  that they are either related in some special way or are forever separate, but 
  instead to show how self and world are actually united from the start separated 
  only by thought itself (the 'understanding', as we shall see). As Hegel later 
  put this point in the Encyclop‘dia: 'It is thinking which both inflicts the 
  wound and heals it again.' And in the 'Difference' essay he says: 'When the 
  might of union vanishes from the life of men, and the antitheses lose their 
  living connection and reciprocity and gain independence, the need for philosophy 
  arises.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel believes philosophy must 
  do, then, is reunite thought and being, or rather to demonstrate their genuine 
  -and original- unity (i.e. that it is not the search for an artificial 'synthesis' 
  which motivates philosophy, but the necessity to demonstrate the true, concrete 
  inter-relation of man and nature). The oppositions of subject and object, self 
  and world, reason and sensibility, and so on must be overcome, and it is philosophy 
  which must reveal (rather than force or fabricate) their intrinsic unity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This unity, however, cannot be achieved 
  through the proposition of a dogmatic metaphysic -such as Fichte's (or any of 
  Schelling's) which merely asserts a unified relation of self and other. Rather, 
  Hegel argues that one must show the common ground from which these oppositions 
  proceed and in which alone they can subsist. It is the 'understanding', he says, 
  which holds onto fixed determinations and oppositions while 'reason' grasps 
  the totality and thus overcomes the artificial distinctions of thought. This 
  simultaneous overcoming and reconciliation ('Aufheben') constitutes the project 
  of the Phenomenology of Mind, and thus also provides us with a preview of Hegel's 
  achievement in its conclusion with 'absolute knowing'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we have seen up to now, the intellectual 
  context of Hegel's first book is both Kant's critical philosophy and more immediately 
  the centrality of self-consciousness regarded as the basis of philosophical 
  enquiry- i.e. as exemplified in the appropriation and/or modification of Kant's 
  ideas by Fichte and Schelling. The problem with the primacy attributed to self-consciousness, 
  however, as Hegel demonstrates in the Phenomenology, is that it is not as immediate 
  and absolute as the post-Kantian idealists would have us believe. Fichte wants 
  to claim that the self's self-knowing in self-consciousness is immediate, irrefutable, 
  and therefore classifiable as genuine knowledge, and then to proceed to establish 
  the larger system of truths contingent upon this relation. What Hegel shows 
  to the contrary is that, in beginning with self-consciousness Fichte is not 
  making the pure, presuppositionless start he believes- for self-consciousness 
  -as the Phenomenology demonstrates- is not simply given or present, but must 
  be achieved; it is, in short, a result.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To state briefly Hegel's main point 
  in the first part of the Phenomenology, then: one cannot be simply self-aware; 
  one must first be aware of something else (as something else)- i.e. a world 
  which appears distinct from one, and which reflects one's consciousness back 
  upon oneself (i.e. as one becomes aware of his awareness). This is what self-consciousness 
  is for Hegel and he does not merely assume or posit it, but, as we have said 
  above, he demonstrates it. In a sense, contrary to taking self-consciousness 
  as its starting point, the genuinely phenomenological part of the Phenomenology 
  leads up to it as its conclusion, and the only way to get there is to work our 
  way up from the beginning in what Hegel calls the 'endless labour of spirit'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind runs 
  approximately five hundred pages in length. Robert Solomon's and Jean Hyppolite's 
  studies of it, for example, both run over six hundred pages. It goes without 
  saying, then, that it will not be possible even to scratch the immense surface 
  of this truly epic work in this chapter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: For the details I must for 
  obvious reasons defer the reader to the Phenomenology itself and its many commentaries: 
  particularly Solomon's and Hyppolite's, or, on a more modest scale: Henry Harris 
  and Richard Norman—both of whom have written useful books of around a hundred 
  pages each. To the more adventurous I can recommend the lectures by Heidegger 
  mentioned above, while Kenneth Westphal's 30-page summary of it in Chapter 10 
  of his Hegel's Epistemological Realism is exemplary for both its brevity and 
  comprehensiveness. (John Findlay's paragraph-by-paragraph analysis on Hegel's 
  text—included in Miller's translation—is also often a helpful aid.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In contrast to the efforts of the 
  above authors to tell us what Hegel says in the Phenomenology, I shall merely 
  attempt below the difficult enough task of briefly summarizing the over-all 
  structure of Hegel's argument and attempt to explain what, in general, he is 
  trying to accomplish.</font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel was obviously aware of the 
  lack of precedent for a book such as the Phenomenology and of the potential 
  for confusion and incomprehension this unfamiliarity could cause. Therefore 
  after he completed the main body of the text and to supplement the modest Introduction 
  he had already written he composed his famous (and much more substantial) Preface 
  which he hoped would prepare his readers for the new kind of philosophy they 
  would encounter within. In this Preface he boldly claims: 'ours is a birth-time 
  and a period of transition to a new era.' 'Spirit', he says, (clearly referring 
  to the 'world-spirit')</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>is indeed never at rest but always 
  engaged in moving forward. But just as the first breath drawn by a child after 
  its long, quiet nourishment breaks the gradualness of mere quantitative growth- 
  there is a qualitative leap and the child is born- so likewise spirit in its 
  formation matures slowly and quietly into its new shape- dissolving bit by bit 
  the structure of its previous world- whose tottering state is only hinted at 
  by isolated symptoms.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Outside his lectures on the history 
  of philosophy Hegel rarely refers to anyone by name, but his remark here about 
  'isolated symptoms' revealing the 'tottering state' of philosophy clearly refers 
  to the problems we examined above—such as Kant's 'thing-in-itself', Fichte's 
  'absolute ego', Schelling's 'absolute identity', and so on. These problems are 
  what Hegel sees as 'the vague foreboding of something unknown.... the heralds 
  of approaching change.' Most dramatically in this respect, he declares: 'The 
  gradual crumbling that left unaltered the face of the whole is cut short by 
  a sunburst which in one flash illuminates the features of the new world.' This 
  'sunburst', of course, is the Enlightenment (with its rationality, liberalism, 
  natural science, etc.), while that which we glimpse in its glow are the materials 
  Hegel takes up and unfolds in 'the new world' of the Phenomenology itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If Hegel has something new to say, 
  however, why does he not just come right out and say it? What truth could take 
  500 pages merely to introduce (since the Phenomenology is not even a presentation 
  of Hegel's system, but only its prologue)? Hegel himself is clearly aware of 
  this question:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now, because the system of the experience 
  of mind [i.e. the Phenomenology itself] embraces only the appearance of mind, 
  the advance from this [preliminary phenomenological] system to the science of 
  the true in its true shape [i.e. the system of science as such] seems to be 
  merely negative, and one might wish to be spared the negative... and demand 
  to be led to the truth without more ado. Why bother with the false?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In short, Hegel's answer is that 
  '[the] truth is not a minted coin that can be given and pocketed ready-made', 
  '[n]or is there such a thing as the false'. If there were a false—something 
  not part of the true—it would then be something somehow left-over. When we realize 
  the truth in the end, Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>it is not truth as if the disparity 
  had been thrown away like dross from pure metal, not even like a tool which 
  remains separate from the finished vessel; disparity rather as the negative... 
  is itself still directly present in the true as such. Yet we cannot therefore 
  say that the false is a moment of the true, let alone a component part of it. 
  To say that in every falsehood is a grain of truth is to treat the two like 
  oil and water which cannot be mixed and are only externally combined. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel is doing is trying to 
  prepare us for what is to come. His point is that if we really want to know 
  the truth, we have to get there; it is the getting -as much as the 'there' itself- 
  which is important. Once we attain the truth -'absolute knowing'- we find that 
  we cannot then simply forget about our journey, for it turns out that it is 
  the journey itself which is the truth. This is what Hegel means by saying that 
  the truth is not a shiny coin we find along the road; it is the road itself—the 
  implication being that we cannot say much about 'absolute knowing' in advance, 
  but must instead wait until we have traversed the path.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'The real issue', Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>is not exhausted by stating it 
  as an aim, but by carrying it out; nor is the result the actual whole, but rather 
  the result together with the process through which it came about. The aim by 
  itself is a lifeless universal, just as the guiding tendency is a mere drive 
  which as yet lacks an actual existence. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We shall come to this all-important 
  'guiding tendency' in due course, but first, returning to the image of the path, 
  there are two important characteristics we should note: first, the path itself 
  is what Hegel calls 'science', and second, as we have seen, that it takes the 
  form of a circle. '[T]his pathway', he says, 'is the science of the experience 
  which consciousness goes through', and its 'movement is the circle which returns 
  into itself- the circle which presupposes its beginning, and reaches it only 
  at the end.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Considering first the Phenomenology's 
  'scientific' aspect (which, as we shall see, is directly related to its 'circularity') 
  we should note initially that what we usually think of as being 'scientific' 
  is how something is done- that is, the way it is carried out, and in this respect 
  Hegel is no different, though his 'how' differs significantly from what we usually 
  mean by 'scientific method' today. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">When Hegel describes the phenomenology 
  of mind as 'the science of the experience of consciousness', he means that 'we 
  do not need to import criteria, or make use of our own bright ideas and thoughts 
  during the course of the inquiry. It is precisely when we leave these aside 
  that we succeed in contemplating the matter in hand as it is in and for itself.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since truth, Hegel says, is 'its 
  own self-movement', and 'since what consciousness examines [in its search for 
  truth] is its own self, all that is left for us to do is simply to look on.' 
  But, we may ask, how 'simple' is this 'science of experience'? 'In the case 
  of all other sciences', Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[as well as] arts, skills, and 
  crafts, everyone is convinced that a complex and laborious programme of learning 
  and practice is necessary for competence. Yet when it comes to philosophy there 
  seems to be a currently prevailing prejudice to the effect that although not 
  everyone who has eyes and fingers and is given leather and last is at once in 
  a position to make shoes, everyone nevertheless immediately understands how 
  to philosophize... [as if] philosophical competence consisted precisely in an 
  absence of information and study .</i></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: 'It is not a pleasant experience', 
  Hegel adds, 'to see ignorance and a crudity without form... which cannot focus 
  its thought on a single abstract proposition -still less on a connected chain 
  of them- claiming at one moment to be freedom of thought... and the next to 
  be even genius. Genius, as we all know, was once all the rage in poetry as it 
  now is in philosophy.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's remedy to this state of 
  affairs is the Phenomenology of Mind itself—which, in this way, can be seen 
  to be a complete reconstruction of philosophy—i.e. Hegel's going back to the 
  beginning and starting over. Thus Hegel's argument (which he regards as a demonstration) 
  begins with 'natural consciousness' or 'ordinary' thinking. Hegel says: 'The 
  element of immediate existence is... what distinguishes this part of science'. 
  This is what makes the Phenomenology 'phenomenological'&shy;—its commencement 
  with phenomena, i.e. immediate experience and common sense- with what is directly 
  there in front of us and therefore most familiar. But, Hegel warns, 'the familiar 
  -just because it is familiar- is not cognitively understood. The commonest way 
  in which we deceive either ourselves or others about understanding is by assuming 
  something as familiar and accepting it on that account'. Consequently, what 
  we can expect from the Phenomenology is a rigorous examination of what we might 
  at first take to be familiar consciousness and experience. Hegel says: 'The 
  true shape in which truth exists can only be the scientific system of such truth. 
  To help bring philosophy closer to the form of science -to the goal where it 
  can lay aside the title &quot;love of knowing&quot; and be actual knowing—that 
  is what I have set myself to do.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus we have now heard that the 
  Phenomenology is not only scientific and circular, but also 'systematic'. What 
  this third term means, we shall see, is that Hegel's scientific approach itself 
  results in the production of a system of philosophy (rather than in some cut 
  and dried truth)- a system which has the form of a circle, and which is itself 
  an expression of 'the absolute'. As such, Hegel says, this philosophy 'can be 
  justified only by the exposition of the system itself'. Unfortunately, however, 
  as we already know, this system fills the three volumes of the Encyclopedia 
  (which itself is merely an outline). (Hegel himself, when asked for a brief 
  summary of his philosophy, is said to have responded: 'Such things are not easily 
  summarized!')</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In any event, in the Preface to 
  the Phenomenology, Hegel does attempt to provide us with as straight-forward 
  a statement as possible of what his philosophy is all about. He says: 'In my 
  view, which can be justified only by the exposition of the system itself, everything 
  turns on grasping and expressing the true not only as substance, but equally 
  as subject.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What this is supposed to mean (aside 
  from the demand that we engage with the book as a whole and not expect to find 
  its meaning condensed into a preface) is that what really is -the truth of being 
  or 'the absolute'- is not merely substance, but substance which is subject. 
  (Hegel speaks of the Phenomenology itself as 'opening up the fast-locked nature 
  of substance and raising this to self-consciousness'.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'Substance', it should be noted, 
  means much the same for Hegel as it does for any other philosopher (from Parmenides 
  to Schelling)- that is: substance is simply that which is. (In his lectures 
  on the philosophy of world history, Hegel defines substance as: 'that through 
  which and in which all reality has its being and subsistence'.) In modern philosophy 
  the answer to the question of what is has usually been answered by saying that 
  everything in the universe is subsumable under either one or two categories; 
  in other words: the universe is made up of either one or two 'substances'- generally 
  distinguishable as 'mind' and 'matter'. One may thus either be a 'monist' or 
  a 'dualist'- from which the possibility of three metaphysical positions emerges: 
  (1) and (2) that the universe is composed of a single substance- mind (as in 
  Berkeley's 'idealism') or matter (as in Hobbes' 'materialism'), or (3) that 
  the two substances mind and matter make up the universe together (as in the 
  'mind-body dualism' of Descartes).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: Other marginal responses to 
  this question have included 'neutral monism'- which claims there is only one 
  substance, but it is neither mental nor physical, and 'pluralism'- which states 
  that the universe cannot simply be reduced to the existence of just one or two 
  kinds of thing, but is constituted by a plurality of substances.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel effectively does in saying 
  that we must conceive of substance as subject is to reject not only the standard 
  monist accounts of the world as constituted either by our own thought or as 
  something independent which is the object of our thought [that is, both 'subjectivism' 
  and 'objectivism' (whether idealist or materialist)], but also the so-called 
  'identity philosophy' propounded especially by Schelling. Schelling did, in 
  fact, attempt to argue for the unity of substance and subject -of being and 
  thought- but he succeeded only in postulating an immediate, and therefore empty, 
  absolute- that is, he postulated thought itself -or 'intuition'- as substance 
  so that there is no distinction between them, and therefore no genuine account 
  of the actual being of either. (Hegel refers to this sort of philosophizing 
  as 'the rapturous enthusiasm which, like the shot from a pistol begins straightaway 
  with absolute knowledge, and makes short work of other standpoints by declaring 
  it takes no notice of them.') Hegel famously characterizes Schelling's simple 
  undifferentiated absolute where 'all is one' and subject and object are 'identical' 
  as 'the night in which... all cows are black'. In other words, he says, 'this 
  is cognition na‹vely reduced to vacuity.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To return to the point of Hegel's 
  linking of substance and subjectivity, we read further that</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the living substance is being 
  which is in truth subject... This substance, as subject, is pure simple negativity, 
  and is for this very reason the bifurcation of the simple; it is the doubling 
  which sets up opposition, and then again the negation of this indifferent diversity... 
  Only this self-restoring sameness... not an original or immediate unity as such 
  [as in Schelling] is the true. It is the process of its own becoming- the circle 
  that presupposes it end as its goal- having its end also as its beginning; and 
  only by being worked out to its end is it actual.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What is clear from this statement 
  is that for Hegel neither subject nor object, nor their undifferentiated unity 
  (i.e. 'identity') is 'absolute' since an absolute which stands on one side -whether 
  that of subject or object, thought or being- is no absolute at all; for the 
  other side would then be 'left over' and the absolute would have to be supposed 
  to exist in relation to the non-absolute- suggesting, improbably enough, that 
  the absolute itself is not absolute but relative (i.e. relative to what is not 
  absolute).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The true is the whole; and the 
  whole is nothing other than the essence consummating itself through its development. 
  Of the absolute it must be said that it is essentially a result, that only in 
  the end is it what it truly is; and that precisely in this consists its nature- 
  that is to be actual, subject, the spontaneous becoming of itself.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The true, as we have seen, is not 
  a result in the sense of a single, simple answer -e.g. 'all is one'- but instead 
  is constituted by the process of truth-seeking itself; the result is the process- 
  the becoming of the absolute. This truth cannot simply be stated, but must be 
  demonstrated or exemplified in the development of the system of philosophy. 
  This is what Hegel means when he says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Just as little as a building 
  is finished when its foundation has been laid, so little is the achieved Concept 
  of the whole the whole itself. When we wish to see an oak with its massive trunk 
  and spreading branches and foliage we are not content to be shown an acorn instead. 
  So too science -the crown of a world of spirit- is not complete in its beginnings.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Unfortunately, Hegel says, it is 
  just this living process of philosophy which is 'rejected with horror'. The 
  absolute is the whole- the whole tree including its growth and development; 
  but in reaching out to the tree -for something solid and stable- philosophers 
  grasp only the acorn and are satisfied- not realizing the acorn must be planted 
  and that they will not know the truth until it has grown into an oak itself 
  and, we could say, returned to the beginning of the process in its generation 
  of new acorns. (What we shall see below is that the Phenomenology is an oak 
  whose growth we watch. The acorn it yields is what Hegel calls 'the Concept', 
  and, when planted what grows is the ensuing encyclop‘dic system of Hegel's philosophy. 
  In other words, in relation to Hegel's system, the whole Phenomenology is, as 
  we noted above, merely prologue.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Before turning to that system itself 
  in Part Two, we must make some attempt -however crude- to say what is in the 
  Phenomenology itself- what experiences consciousness goes through and what Hegel 
  makes of this journey.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The whole text can be said to be 
  a story of relations- fourteen in all, which Hegel calls 'forms' of consciousness 
  or 'stations' of the mind along its path toward 'absolute knowing' [not unlike 
  the Christian 'Stations of the Cross' (which also number fourteen)]. The Phenomenology's 
  stations represent the relations of consciousness to its object- i.e. between 
  self and other, with two exceptions; the first station -'sense-certainty'- does 
  entail a relation of consciousness to an object, but, as we shall see, since 
  only the other is present to the self (and not the self itself) the relation 
  is known only to us as phenomenological observers- we who 'look on', in Hegel's 
  phrase. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: David Parry has written an 
  entire book on the philosopher's role as observer in the Phenomenology called 
  Hegel's Phenomenology of the &quot;We&quot;. (See Bibliography.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The last form of consciousness—‘absolute 
  knowing’—is also a relation, but—to allude to Hegel's conclusion in advance—the 
  self's other in this case is the self itself. This knowing, we can finally say 
  -if still only provisionally- is what 'spirit' is- spirit is absolute knowing's 
  coming-to-be. Spirit is the self's discovery of itself, and therefore its return 
  to itself in and through its other. Spirit is the self's unification with itself 
  in what at first it took to be foreign to itself. In spirit, then, self and 
  world, thought and being, subject and object, and so on, are reconciled with 
  each other and known in their truth.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The journey to this point, however, 
  is neither quick nor easy. n fact Hegel says it may be regarded as ‘the pathway 
  of doubt, or more precisely, as the way of despair.’ This is not only because 
  the reasoning behind consciousness' transitions from one form to another (which 
  Hegel refers to as its 'successive awakenings') are often complex, but also 
  because of the length of time needed to complete the journey—which is the entirety 
  of human history (dramatically described by Hegel in the Philosophy of History 
  as the 'altar upon which the happiness of nations, the wisdom of states, and 
  the virtue of individuals are slaughtered'). Viewed as a whole, Hegel says, 
  the Phenomenology 'presents a slow-moving succession of spirits—a gallery of 
  images each of which, endowed with all the riches of the mind, moves thus slowly 
  just because the self has to penetrate and digest this entire wealth of its 
  substance.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If Hegel's Phenomenology shows one 
  thing it is that one cannot simply jump straight into philosophy as such. If 
  we seek comprehensiveness we must start over from the beginning of thought itself- 
  demonstrating the path consciousness takes in its development from ordinary, 
  everyday experience all the way up to the genuinely philosophical vantage point 
  of 'absolute knowing'—an odyssey we shall now consider in itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the strictly phenomenological 
  part of its exegesis (the part which leads up to 'spirit' itself), the Phenomenology 
  of Mind is divided into three sections: 'consciousness', 'self-consciousness', 
  and 'reason'. Turning first to ‘consciousness’, we find that it too is divided 
  into three sub-sections: 'sense-certainty', 'perception', and 'understanding'. 
  We may remark in advance that this 'circle' of phenomenology represents the 
  progression from ordinary experience to knowledge of what Hegel calls 'the Concept'—which 
  turns out to be a comprehensive understanding of ordinary experience itself, 
  of our relation as knowers to what we know. (In the Science of Logic, Hegel 
  calls this the 'unveiling of substance' and thus 'the genesis of the Concept'.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The first section 'sense-certainty' 
  itself has three aspects: first, that of which 'sense-certainty' is certain—the 
  object; second, that which is certain—the 'I' or subject; and finally, the 'truth 
  of sense-certainty'—which is seen to be neither the one nor the other on its 
  own, but the two comprehended as a unity—that is, one (the object) as perceived 
  by the other (the subject). Thus it is 'perception'—the second form of consciousness—which 
  is the 'truth of sense-certainty'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 'perception' consciousness is 
  conscious of its awareness of something else—that is, of itself as a subject 
  perceiving an object. What the subject perceives, however, is no longer what 
  is simply there in experience (as in 'sense-certainty'), but now what Hegel 
  calls 'the thing with many properties'. Perception breaks experience down and 
  does so in two ways: first into perceiver and perceived (subject and object), 
  and then it breaks up the object as well. What consciousness perceives is not 
  simply a singular object, but a thing with multiple attributes. Hegel uses the 
  example of salt: his point (perhaps surprising at first) is that salt, as such, 
  cannot be perceived; salt itself is not an object of perception; what is perceived 
  is salt's white colour, its salty taste, the shape of its crystals, etc. What 
  holds these properties together is not simply another property—i.e. 'saltness'—but 
  an idea. Hegel's point is that what salt is—as the unity of diverse properties—is 
  really a concept—and, as such, it cannot be perceived, but must be understood. 
  Realizing this 'truth of perception', then, brings us to the third form of consciousness: 
  'understanding'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What 'understanding' understands 
  (i.e. conceives as opposed to perceives) is that underlying 'perception' there 
  are concepts—universal ideas such as unity, multiplicity, cause, effect, etc.—without 
  which perceptual knowledge would be impossible. The immediate difficulty of 
  this 'realization', however, is that it suggests the existence of some transcendental 
  world (inhabited by what Hegel calls 'forces') to which these concepts apply—as 
  if what we really perceive is the mere appearance of a realm of essences (i.e. 
  ‘things-in-themselves’). If this were true then the essence of things would 
  remain unknowable and genuine (i.e. 'absolute') knowledge impossible (as in 
  Kant).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's solution to this dilemma—the 
  legacy of Kant's 'Copernican Revolution'—we could say, is to mount his own epistemological 
  counter-revolution in that his strategy is to reject Kant's idea that the 'thing-in-itself' 
  is the essence (or 'substance') behind the 'curtain of appearance'—thereby denying 
  that the scope of our knowledge is limited to the structure of our own thought. 
  The way Hegel does this is by showing that the understanding realizes that its 
  concepts—whether Kantian-style categories, or 'forces', laws of nature, etc. 
  —do not really explain anything, but only redescribe phenomena in other terms—from 
  which it follows that the understanding has not really discovered anything new 
  at all, but instead has merely stumbled upon its own activity of describing. 
  Behind appearances, then, is not some unknowable substance, thing-in-itself, 
  or any other transcendental 'essence', but only our own self giving structure 
  to experience. Objects, in other words, are endowed with objectivity by subjects 
  (just as subjects are 'subjective' only in relation to objects). The world is 
  only real—that is, it is the way (and therefore what) it is—because of the comprehending 
  power of consciousness. (Consciousness discovers that it itself 'stands behind' 
  its objects, and thus can be seen to constitute the 'objectivity' of the world.) 
  As Hegel puts it: 'there is nothing to be seen [behind the curtain] unless we 
  [lift it and] go behind it ourselves—as much in order that we may see as that 
  there may be something there to be seen.' And stepping thus behind the curtain 
  of appearance to 'essence' (or 'substance') itself, we pass from consciousness 
  to its truth: self-consciousness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'But', Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>at the same time, it is evident 
  that we cannot without more ado go straightaway behind appearance. For this 
  knowledge of what is the truth of appearance as ordinarily conceived, and of 
  its inner being is itself only a result of a complex movement—whereby the modes 
  of consciousness... sense-certainty, perceiving, and understanding vanish; and 
  it will be equally evident that the cognition of what consciousness knows in 
  knowing itself requires a still more complex movement </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Needless to say, we cannot follow 
  the Phenomenology as it bursts forth into history and traces this ‘more complex 
  movement’ though time and its successive ages and civilizations, but we may 
  say here that Hegel's ‘counter-revolution’ is now transformed into the ‘permanent 
  revolution’ of thought—i.e. consciousness (now self-conscious)—to realize itself 
  in the objective world—that is, in reality itself. ‘Self-consciousness’, in 
  Hegel's phrase, must make the world its 'free realization'. The process of knowledge 
  becomes the progression of history as Hegel links the epistemological evolution 
  of consciousness from ‘sense-certainty’ to 'self-consciousness' with the historical 
  development of man from bondage to freedom—from the primitive 'state of nature' 
  to the rights and freedoms of modern constitutional states. The subjective forms 
  of consciousness we have seen up to now are revealed in objective historical 
  realities in an epic narrative of struggle, labour, and cultural and philosophical 
  creation which culminates in ‘absolute knowing’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we shall do now (admittedly 
  against Hegel's advice) is step behind the ‘curtain of reality’ in order to 
  examine ‘the truth of appearance’ itself—its ‘inner being’ independent of its 
  outer modes of consciousness. Behind the curtain, then, is what Hegel calls 
  ‘logic’—and in contrast to the experiential progression of the preceding phenomenological 
  study it is now the purely logical unfolding of ‘the Concept’ which shall concern 
  us. Thus we must consider briefly the Phenomenology's final ‘station’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In a phrase, Hegel describes the 
  Phenomenology of Mind as the ‘coming-to-be of science as such’. This pure knowledge 
  is the content of ‘absolute knowing’, and Hegel calls it ‘the Concept’. The 
  Concept for Hegel, as opposed to ordinary concepts, is, as we have seen, the 
  notion that thought and reality are not opposed, but inherently unified. This 
  idea is the result of Hegel's phenomenological investigation—and, as such, forms 
  the subject-matter of his next work: the Science of Logic. In this study Hegel 
  says the Concept</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>displays its existence and movement 
  in this ether of its life and is science [as such]. In this, the moments of 
  its movement no longer exhibit themselves as specific forms of consciousness, 
  but—since consciousness' difference [between itself and its other] has returned 
  into the self—as specific concepts and as their organic self-grounded movement.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Science of Logic, then, exhibits 
  ‘the structure [of the Phenomenology] set forth in its pure essentiality’. ‘Absolute 
  knowing’ is knowledge of the Concept, and therefore knowledge that the disparity 
  between self and other is an inadequacy in the self itself—i.e. the self's inability 
  to understand ‘the other’ in its truth. When the self does understand objectivity, 
  and both (objectivity and subjectivity) are seen for what they are—that is, 
  as the two moments of ‘substance’—then the subject-object relation disappears 
  in the Concept, and phenomenology yields to logic (i.e. the Concept's own immanent 
  development). This realization is what Hegel calls: ‘the true in the form of 
  the true, and their difference [i.e. between subject and object] is only the 
  difference of content. Their movement, which organizes itself in this element 
  into a whole, is logic or speculative philosophy.’</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As a final recapitulation of the 
  Phenomenology as the 'science of experience', Hegel says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[E]xperience is just this, that 
  the content—which is spirit [i.e. knowledge of the true relation of self to 
  other]—is in itself substance; and therefore an object of consciousness. But 
  this substance which is spirit is the process in which spirit becomes what it 
  is in itself; and it is only as this process of reflecting itself into itself 
  that it is in itself truly spirit. It is in itself the movement which is cognition—the 
  transformation of that which is in itself&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy; into that 
  which is for itself, of substance into subject, of the object of consciousness 
  into an object of self-consciousness, i.e.... into the Concept. The movement 
  is the circle which returns into itself...</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All throughout the ‘labour’ of the 
  Phenomenology this ‘movement’ has been taking place ‘for us’—the phenomenological 
  observers who ‘look on’, and therefore, as Hegel describes it, ‘behind the back 
  of consciousness’. In proceeding to logic, then, we are (‘without more ado’) 
  ‘looking behind’ experience to the structure and development of thought itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">PART TWO</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Phenomenology of Mind is often 
  described as a book with no precedents. Hegel's second work, Science of Logic, 
  on the other hand, is a work whose subject-matter can be said to be as old as 
  philosophy itself (and to have existed in a mature form at least since Aristotle).But 
  this long and distinguished provenance may not, Hegel suggests, have served 
  logic well. In the first sentence of the Preface to the Science of Logic Hegel 
  speaks of the ‘complete transformation’ which philosophy has undergone in recent 
  years—but also, unfortunately, how these changes have had 'but little influence 
  as yet on the structure of logic.' Since Aristotle, he says, logic 'has not 
  lost any ground, but neither has it gained any—the latter because to all appearances 
  it seems to be finished and complete.' From the 800 or so pages which follow 
  this remark, we may confidently assume that Hegel himself is far from accepting 
  that logic is something 'finished and complete'. Indeed, he argues that</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>if logic has not undergone any 
  change since Aristotle -and, in fact, judging by modern compendia... the changes 
  frequently consist mainly in omissions- then surely the conclusion which should 
  be drawn is that it is all the more in need of a total reconstruction; for spirit 
  -after its labours over 2000 years- must have attained a higher consciousness 
  about its thinking and about its own pure, essential nature.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">No doubt one of (if not the) most 
  significant examples of spirit's 'higher consciousness'—that is, of philosophy's 
  'complete transformation' in recent times (in Hegel's mind, at any rate) —is 
  Hegel's own Phenomenology of Mind. Therefore, it should come as no surprise 
  that Hegel proposes to base his ‘total reconstruction’ of logic on the outcome 
  of the Phenomenology—that is, the Concept attained at the level of ‘absolute 
  knowing’. In the Introduction to the Science of Logic, he says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>In the Phenomenology of Mind 
  I have exhibited consciousness in its movement onwards from the first immediate 
  opposition of itself and its object [i.e. 'sense-certainty'] to absolute knowing. 
  The path of this movement goes through every form of the relation of consciousness 
  to its object and has the Concept of science for its result. This Concept cannot 
  be justified in any other way than by this emergence in consciousness- all the 
  forms of which are resolved into this Concept as into their truth. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The subject-matter of logic, then, 
  is what Hegel calls the 'immanent development' of this Concept. Therefore, it 
  is now thought itself -pure thinking (rather than the experience of consciousness)- 
  which develops- unfolding the logical structure of the conceptual relations 
  implicit in 'absolute knowing' and 'resolved' into the Concept itself ('as into 
  their truth').</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we shall be considering here 
  first of all, then, is the overall structure of Hegel's logic and its three 
  individual parts: ‘Being’, ‘Essence’, and ‘Concept’. As we shall see, the relation 
  of these ‘doctrines’ constitutes logic's over-all structure—which Hegel describes 
  as ‘dialectical’; and to get a better understanding of the workings of dialectic 
  we shall consider its first and best known example: the ‘being-nothing-becoming’ 
  triad. Then we will see how Hegel distinguishes this sort of thinking—which 
  he describes as the product of ‘speculative reason’—from the ordinary, 'one-sided' 
  analysis of the understanding, and also how ‘speculative reason’ opens up the 
  possibility of ‘infinite knowledge’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In his introductory lecture on the 
  history of philosophy, Hegel declares: ‘Thought is not something empty and abstract, 
  but is determining—indeed self-determining; in other words, thought is essentially 
  concrete. This concrete thought is what we call “the Concept”.’ Any thought, 
  of course—just as a thought—Hegel admits, is a concept; but the Concept, he 
  explains, is ‘different’.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Concept is genuine knowledge, 
  not thought qua purely universal; on the contrary, the Concept is thought determining 
  itself- thought in its vivacity and activity, or thought giving its content 
  to itself. In other words: the Concept is the universal which particularizes 
  itself... The Concept is thought become active—able to determine itself, create 
  and generate itself; thus it is not merely a form for some content; it forms 
  itself, gives itself a content, and makes itself the form.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Later, when we come to the end of 
  logic, we shall see that the fully 'self-determined' or 'realized' Concept is 
  what Hegel calls 'the Idea' (and further, that the full realization of the Idea 
  as the unity of the Concept and reality is the 'absolute idea'). But before 
  we set off down this road to logic's apotheosis we should first acquaint ourselves 
  with the work which will be our guide. The Science of Logic is, as Hegel himself 
  referred to it, the 'sequel' to the Phenomenology of Mind, and was published 
  in two separate volumes in 1812 and 1816- each containing half of logic's division 
  into 'objective' and 'subjective' 'moments'. These volumes break down further 
  into the individual 'doctrines' of 'Being' and 'Essence' in 'objective' logic, 
  and the 'doctrine of the Concept' in 'subjective' logic. (We shall see below 
  that 'the Concept' itself has its own subjective and objective moments.) To 
  elaborate further we could say that 'objective' logic's doctrines of 'Being' 
  and 'Essence' cover what we would ordinarily think of as ontology or metaphysics, 
  and that 'subjective' logic is concerned -at least in part- with epistemological 
  issues or more 'formal' logic as such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'Subjective' logic -the 'doctrine 
  of the Concept'- is where the Concept itself explicitly comes under consideration. 
  But, Hegel says, 'the Concept is to be regarded not merely as a subjective proposition 
  [i.e. as any concept], but as the absolute foundation; yet it can be so only 
  in so far as it has made itself the foundation.' This statement, which at first 
  may seem paradoxical -i.e. that the Concept in its ultimate sense must be its 
  own 'absolute foundation' and therefore would seem necessarily to have to precede 
  itself- is meant to demonstrate what Hegel calls the 'speculative' relation 
  between the two (i.e. concepts generally and the Concept). What Hegel means 
  -which, as we saw in the Phenomenology, can really emerge only from the exposition 
  of the entire system of logic itself- is that, like the foundation of a building, 
  the Concept is not simply found ready-made, but must be planned and, to some 
  extent, worked-out in advance. The science of logic, then, can be seen as the 
  designing of the structure which will be built upon the foundation of the Concept- 
  and, as such, a return to the Concept itself; for, to extend our analogy, in 
  an architectural design, the foundation cannot be worked out in detail first, 
  but instead, must simply be assumed in an abstract way at the start, and then 
  returned to in the end to be worked out concretely in order to support the building 
  which has been designed to rest upon it. (As has been noted above, we cannot 
  expect to understand this point fully until we have reached the end ourselves.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thought is an expression which attributes 
  the determination contained therein primarily to consciousness. But inasmuch 
  as it is said that... reason is in the objective world -that mind and nature 
  have universal laws to which their life and development conform- then it is 
  conceded that the determinations of thought equally have objective value and 
  existence. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The project of Hegel's logic is 
  to determine the shape of this 'life and development' of thought. In order to 
  do so, he says, 'it has been necessary to make a completely fresh start with 
  this science.' Again as we saw in the Phenomenology, Hegel regards philosophy 
  as being 'in need of a total reconstruction'; the Science of Logic -as 'the 
  mind's consciousness of its own pure essence'- provides that reconstruction. 
  Logic, Hegel says, is</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the science of pure thought- 
  the principle of which is pure knowing- the unity which is not abstract, but 
  a living, concrete unity in virtue of the fact that in it the opposition in 
  consciousness between a self-determined entity -a subject- and a second such 
  entity -an object- is known to be overcome; being is known to be the pure Concept 
  in its own self, and the pure Concept to be true being. These, then, are the 
  two moments contained in logic. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">It is important to note Hegel's 
  stress on the 'momentary' nature of subjectivity and objectivity as such- that 
  is, their 'opposition in consciousness'; for through being 'worked out' and 
  thus reconciled in the 'objective' and 'subjective' moments of logic, this opposition, 
  Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>has vanished... [while] unity 
  remains the element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development 
  no longer originate outside that element. Consequently, the earlier determinations 
  (those used on the pathway to truth [i.e. the development of logic itself]) 
  such as subjectivity and objectivity, or even thought and being, or concept 
  and reality have lost their independent and purely affirmative character, and 
  are now in their truth -that is, in their unity- reduced to [mere] forms.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Later we shall see that this 'unity' 
  -which Hegel calls the 'truth' of the Concept and reality- is 'the Idea'. But 
  knowing already that the Idea is a result, we cannot expect to happen upon it 
  (or its ultimate form: the 'absolute idea') at the beginning, but must gradually 
  make our way there- following the development of thought itself. Thus, Hegel 
  says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>what is to be considered is the 
  whole Concept- firstly as the Concept in the form of [immediate] being, [and] 
  secondly, as the Concept [as such]; in the first case, the Concept is only in 
  itself- the concept of reality or being; in the second case, it is the Concept 
  as such- the Concept existing for itself... Accordingly, logic should be divided 
  primarily into the logic of the Concept as Being, and of the Concept as Concept- 
  or, by employing the usual terms (although these -being the least definite- 
  are most ambiguous) into 'objective' and 'subjective' logic.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'Objective' logic, then, treats 
  the Concept as the concept of something else- that is, as Being, or what objectively 
  is, while 'subjective' logic is concerned with the Concept itself as what truly 
  is. In other words: reality, what is -in order objectively to be- requires the 
  subjectivity of the Concept itself. Hegel explains that</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>in accordance with the fundamental 
  element of the immanent unity of [both the 'objective' and 'subjective' moments 
  of] the Concept, and hence with the inseparability of its determinations, these 
  latter -when distinguished from each other in the positing of the Concept in 
  its difference- must at least also stand in relation to each other. There results 
  [then] a sphere of mediation: the Concept as a system of reflected determinations- 
  that is, of being in process of transition into the... inwardness of the Concept 
  [itself]. In this way, the Concept is not yet posited as such for itself, but 
  is still fettered by the externality of immediate being. This is the doctrine 
  of Essence which stands midway between the doctrine of Being and that of the 
  Concept.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Here, then -in a particularly dense 
  statement- is Hegel's outline of the structure and meaning (which we know are 
  closely linked) of his entire logic. First of all we should note that Hegel 
  takes as given (i.e., as demonstrated by the Phenomenology) the dual nature 
  of the Concept- that is, its subjective and objective aspects- its subjectivity 
  in terms of being thought, and its objectivity in being the thought of something- 
  namely of the relation between the thinker and that of which he is thinking. 
  It is this distinction of the Concept's objective and subjective moments which 
  constitutes what Hegel refers to as 'the positing of the Concept in its difference'. 
  This difference sets up a logical 'dialectic' in which these aspects 'stand 
  in relation to each other', and thus entails the 'sphere of mediation' which 
  constitutes the doctrine of Essence.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In short: in logic's first doctrine, 
  the Concept is posited as Being- i.e. the objective Being of beings, or of what 
  is. But this being proves to be inadequate as an expression of what really is- 
  which is subsequently thought to lie behind existent beings as their Essence 
  (logic's second doctrine). Finally, the Concept itself (as the Idea) is realized 
  to constitute the absolute (that is: the unity of being and thought- of reality 
  and the Concept)- thus concluding logic with the 'absolute idea'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To return specifically to Hegel's 
  project to reconstruct logic, we find that he discerns the need for this enterprize 
  in the recognition that</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[t]he activity of thought which 
  is at work in all our ideas, purposes, interests and actions is... unconsciously 
  busy (natural logic); what we attend to is the contents, the objects of our 
  ideas- that in which we are interested. On this basis the determinations of 
  thought have the significance of forms which are only attached to the content 
  but are not the content itself.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel is suggesting is that 
  thinking itself is not an empty form like a meaningless, arbitrary code whose 
  message can be extracted and considered independently. Instead thought has its 
  own immanent meaning and significance- that is, its own content- which the study 
  of logic reveals.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Logic is the study of concepts, 
  or the Concept- which Hegel calls the 'immanent universal'. In all our thinking, 
  he says, '[t]he indispensable foundation, the Concept, the universal which is 
  thought itself, insofar as one can abstract from the general idea expressed 
  by the word &quot;thought&quot; cannot be regarded as only an indifferent form 
  attached to a content.' Concepts, and especially the Concept, are 'the very 
  heart of things'. 'To focus attention on this logical nature which animates 
  the mind- moves and works in it- this is the task.' This is what the Science 
  of Logic sets out to do- the need for which Hegel accounts for by saying:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>when the content of an interest 
  in which one is absorbed is drawn out of its immediate unity with oneself and 
  becomes an independent object of one's thinking, it is then that the mind begins 
  to be free, whereas when thinking is an instinctive activity the mind is enmeshed 
  in the bonds of its categories and is broken up into an infinitely varied material.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 'lofty business' of logic, Hegel 
  says, is 'to clarify these categories, and [then] in them to raise the mind 
  to freedom and truth.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The most important thing for the 
  nature of the mind is not only the relation of what it is in itself to what 
  it is in actuality, but the relation of what it knows itself to be to what it 
  actually is; because the mind is essentially consciousness, this self-knowing 
  is a fundamental determination of its actuality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What Hegel suggests here about 'truth' 
  -'the declared object and aim of logic'- is that, since consciousness and thought 
  underlie everything we experience and know, it turns out to be thinking itself 
  rather than what is being thought about which must occupy the central position 
  in our search for truth (and freedom). This is what Hegel means when he says 
  that the 'subjective act' must be 'grasped as an essential moment of objective 
  truth, and this brings with it the need to unite the method with the content- 
  the form with the principle.' 'The inadequacy of the [conventional] way of regarding 
  thought -which leaves truth on one side', Hegel says, </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">can only be made good by including 
  in our conception of thought not only that which is usually reckoned as belonging 
  to the external form, but the content as well. It is soon evident that what 
  to ordinary reflection is at first [a] content as divorced from form, cannot 
  in fact be formless- cannot be devoid of inner determination.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On the contrary, he continues,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the content in its own self possesses 
  form, [and] in fact it is through form alone that it has soul and meaning, and... 
  it is form itself which is transformed only into the semblance of a content- 
  hence into the semblance of something external to this semblance. With this 
  introduction of the content into the logical treatment the subject matter is 
  not things but their import- the concept of them. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The Concept, then 'is not sensuously 
  intuited or represented; it is solely an object, a product and content of thinking'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Hitherto the concept of logic 
  has rested on the separation -presupposed once and for all in the ordinary consciousness- 
  of the content of cognition and its form, or of truth and certainty. First it 
  is assumed that the material of knowing is present on its own account as a ready-made 
  world apart from thought- that thinking on its own is empty and comes as an 
  external form to the said material, fills itself with it, and only thus acquires 
  a content and so becomes 'real' knowing.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According to this 'common-sense' 
  view of knowledge, Hegel says, form and content -regarded as two externally 
  related 'constituents' of knowledge- are appraised as follows:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[T]he object is regarded as something 
  complete and finished on its own account- something which can entirely dispense 
  with thought for its actuality, while thought on the other hand is regarded 
  as defective because it has to complete itself with a material, and moreover 
  -as a pliable indeterminate form- has to adapt to its material. Truth is the 
  agreement of thought with the object, and in order to bring about this agreement 
  -for it does not exist on its own account- thinking is supposed to adapt and 
  accommodate itself to the object. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The consequence of 'common-sense' 
  for thought and its object is simply, as we saw above in the Phenomenology, 
  that 'each is regarded as a sphere divorced from the other.' Thinking, in this 
  account, Hegel says, 'does not go out of itself to its object; this, as a &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;, 
  remains a sheer beyond of thought.' This view of the relation of subject and 
  object expresses what Hegel calls: 'the determinations which constitute the 
  nature of our ordinary, phenomenal consciousness' which, as such, are generally 
  sufficient for the purposes of ordinary life and conversation. But, Hegel continues, 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>when these prejudices are carried 
  out into the sphere of reason as if the same relation obtained there -as if 
  this relation were something true in its own self- then they are errors the 
  refutation of which, throughout every part of the spiritual and natural universe, 
  is philosophy.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Philosophy, then, is for Hegel both 
  a demonstration of the truth and a refutation of the false- or, at least, a 
  leading of false or 'one-sided' (i.e. partially true) points of view to the 
  truth. The reason this is possible, as we have seen, is that thought itself 
  has its own content, and this content shapes itself into its own form- which 
  is why Hegel remarks: 'It will always stand as a marvel how the Kantian philosophy 
  recognized the relation of thought to sensuous reality -beyond which it did 
  not advance- as only a relative relation of mere appearance'. In saying this, 
  Hegel praises Kant for realizing that the reality we directly experience is 
  not reality in its truth. (For Kant, of course, the world of experience is merely 
  the phenomenal show of the 'noumenal' realm which constitutes what is ultimately 
  real- which is why Hegel goes on to accuse him of having 'stopped short at this 
  relative relation and the assertion that the Concept is and remains utterly 
  separate from reality'.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 'common-sense' belief in the 
  separation of mind and world leads on to the claim that since thought and its 
  object are distinct, then thinking has no direct access to what it is thinking 
  about- that is, no knowledge of its object as it is in itself, but only as it 
  is manifested to thinking. There is thus a distinction not only between subject 
  and object but also between appearance and essence- what a thing really is and 
  how it appears. While clearly an unsatisfying result for knowledge (which is 
  thus sharply curtailed), Hegel characterizes this realization as a 'great negative 
  step towards the true concept of reason.' This step is significant because it 
  takes thought beyond common-sense, and 'negative' because, as Hegel puts it, 
  '[it] is like attributing to someone a correct perception with the rider that 
  nevertheless he is incapable of perceiving what is true but only what is false.' 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Having acknowledged this step, the 
  focus of our consideration can now center on the overall shape and development 
  of Hegel's logic itself. To understand his articulation of this progression 
  -that is, of logic's 'reconstruction'- it is essential to remember -as Hegel 
  continuously reminds us- that 'what is involved is an altogether new concept 
  of scientific procedure.' 'To exhibit the realm of thought philosophically', 
  he says, 'that is, in its own immanent activity, or what is the same, in its 
  necessary developments, has therefore to be a fresh undertaking- one which has 
  to be started right from the beginning'. This 'fresh start' is necessary, Hegel 
  believes, because the traditional material of logic and philosophy generally 
  offers, 'only here and there a meagre shred or a disordered heap of dead bones.' 
  In order to bring this skeleton back to life, he says, 'it can only be the nature 
  of the content itself which spontaneously develops itself in a scientific method 
  of knowing'. What Hegel is alluding to in this statement is what is generally 
  regarded as his most original and significant contribution to philosophy- namely 
  'dialectic'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dialectic is a philosophical practice 
  stretching back almost as far as philosophy itself- appearing first in Zeno's 
  famous paradoxes, and then later more concretely in the dialogues of Plato. 
  It was, however, a particular instance of dialectic in Kant's critical philosophy 
  which most influenced Hegel (as it did Fichte and Schelling). The dialectic 
  in question occurs in the Critique of Pure Reason in Kant's derivation of the 
  four cosmological antimonies of reason- that is, the equally logical, yet contradictory 
  propositions which arise in response to metaphysical questions [such as whether 
  or not time extends infinitely into the past and future (the paradoxical answer 
  being both that it necessarily does and does not)]. Kant regarded these demonstrations 
  of the contradiction inherent in thought itself as proof of reason's inability 
  to negotiate metaphysical issues, and dismissed them as what he called the 'logic 
  of illusion'. Hegel, however, regarded Kant's discovery as 'among his greatest 
  merits'- in that he 'exhibited it [i.e. contradiction] as a necessary function 
  of reason.' Thus what Kant regarded as a negligible by-product of thought's 
  vain attempts to enquire too far, is taken up by Hegel and made a central part 
  of his philosophy. The Kantian antimonies, 'more than anything else', Hegel 
  says, 'brought about the downfall of the previous metaphysics and may be regarded 
  as a major transition into more recent philosophy'. 'True', Hegel says, 'Kant's 
  expositions in the antimonies... do not indeed deserve great praise, but the 
  general idea on which he based his expositions and which he vindicated is the 
  objectivity of the illusion and the necessity of the contradiction which belongs 
  to the nature of the determinations of thought'. The 'result' which Hegel says 
  he takes from this point -'grasped in its positive aspect'- is</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>nothing else but the inner negativity 
  of [thought] determinations in their self-moving soul- the principle of all 
  natural and spiritual life. But if [as in the case of Kant] no advance is made 
  beyond the abstract, negative side of dialectic, the result is the familiar 
  one that reason is incapable of knowing what is infinite [i.e. the 'absolute'].</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 'abstract negative side' is 
  as far as Kant gets with dialectic- regarding its contradictions as 'illusion' 
  and therefore 'proof' of the finitude of knowledge- which is thus unable to 
  answer or even to make sense of metaphysical or 'transcendental' questions. 
  Hegel's project is to go beyond this dead-end- declaring that it is in 'the 
  grasping of opposites in their unity -or of the positive in the negative- that 
  speculative thought consists.' 'Speculative thought' is Hegel's term for the 
  positive 'reconstructive' project which he builds upon Kant's critical foundations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the title of the brief essay 
  which introduces the Science of Logic, Hegel asks: 'With what must the science 
  begin?'. In no other science, he says, </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>is the need to begin with the 
  subject-matter itself without preliminary reflections felt more strongly than 
  in the science of logic. In every other science, the subject-matter and the 
  scientific method are distinguished from each other; also the content does not 
  make an absolute beginning but is dependent on other concepts and is connected 
  on all sides with other material. These other sciences are therefore permitted 
  to speak of their ground and its context and also of their method only as premises 
  taken for granted which as forms of definitions and such-like presupposed as 
  familiar and accepted are to be applied straight-away, and also to employ the 
  usual kind of reasoning for the establishment of their general concepts and 
  fundamental determinations.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And at the opening of the Encyclop‘dia, 
  he remarks:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>It may seem as if philosophy, 
  in order to start on its course, had, like the rest of the sciences, to begin 
  with a subjective presupposition. The sciences postulate their respective objects, 
  such as space, number, or whatever it may be, and it might be supposed that 
  philosophy had also to postulate the existence of thought. But the two cases 
  are not exactly parallel. It is by the free act of thought [itself] that it 
  occupies a point of view in which it is for its own self and thus [it] gives 
  itself an object of its own production.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's point in these passages 
  is that unlike other sciences philosophy does not find its subject-matter ready-made 
  awaiting analysis and codification. The astronomer, for example, does not begin 
  by justifying his study with arguments for the existence of heavenly bodies, 
  but instead advances straight-away to the observation of their movements, the 
  deduction of laws, etc. The furniture of the universe is the astronomer's presupposition- 
  it is taken as given, and his study proceeds from there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The object of the philosopher's 
  study, on the other hand, is not something we encounter out in the world. (In 
  the Phenomenology it was our encounter with the world, while now in logic it 
  is the immanent and underlying conceptual structure of that experience.)</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we are dealing with in logic 
  is not a thinking about something which exists independently as a base for our 
  thought and apart from it, nor forms which are supposed to provide mere signs 
  or distinguishing marks of truth. On the contrary, the necessary forms and self-determinations 
  of thought are the content and the ultimate truth itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Since it is with thought itself 
  that the philosopher is concerned, he finds his object there before him as soon 
  as he begins to think. Thus philosophy requires no telescope but only the philosopher's 
  own mind to proceed. Logic is 'the science of thinking', and, as such, to engage 
  in it is to produce it. As Hegel says: 'the way to science is itself already 
  science'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now that we are in a position to 
  start doing philosophy we must ask ourselves the question with which Hegel opens 
  the Science of Logic: 'With what must the science begin?'. 'The beginning is 
  logical', he says; it 'is to be made in the element of thought that is free 
  and for itself, in pure knowing'. He continues:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Now starting from this determination 
  of pure knowledge, all that is needed to ensure that the beginning remains immanent 
  in its scientific development is to consider -or rather, ridding oneself of 
  all other reflections and opinions whatever- simply to take up what is there 
  before us... [And] what is present is only simple immediacy... [which], in its 
  true expression is pure being... [I]f no presupposition is to be made and the 
  beginning itself is taken immediately then its only determination is that it 
  is to be the beginning of logic- of thought as such. All that is present is 
  simply the resolve -which may also be regarded as arbitrary- that we propose 
  to consider thought as such. Thus the beginning must be an absolute, or what 
  is synonymous here, an abstract beginning, and so it may not presuppose anything, 
  must not be mediated by anything, nor have a ground; rather, it is itself to 
  be the ground of the entire science. Consequently, it must be purely and simply 
  an immediacy, or rather, merely immediacy itself. The beginning, therefore, 
  is pure being.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is Hegel's preliminary explanation 
  of the first concept or category of logic: 'being'. Pure being, Hegel claims, 
  is the logically first thought; it is what is 'there before us' when we begin 
  to think. It is the beginning of the system of philosophy; and, since, as we 
  have seen, that system forms a circle, being is also its end. Being is both 
  the presupposition from which we start and also the goal to which we return. 
  This point of view, Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>which originally is taken on 
  its own evidence only, must in the course of the science [of logic] be converted 
  to a result- the ultimate result in which philosophy returns into itself and 
  reaches the point with which it began. In this manner, philosophy exhibits the 
  appearance of a circle which closes with itself and has no beginning in the 
  way other sciences do.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What this means is that even though 
  Hegel spends many pages in both versions of logic explaining why, as he says, 
  'it lies in the very nature of a beginning that it must be being and nothing 
  else', it does not really matter if we believe or even understand him, because 
  philosophy, in advancing from this point, at the same time returns to and 'grounds' 
  it. This is why Hegel says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the advance is [at the same time] 
  a retreat into the ground, to what is primary and true, on which depends and, 
  in fact, from which originates that with which the beginning is made. Thus consciousness, 
  on its onward path from the immediacy with which it began is led back to absolute 
  knowledge as its inner-most truth. This last -the ground- is then also that 
  from which the first proceeds, that which, at first, appeared as an immediacy... 
  The essential requirement for the science of logic is not so much that the beginning 
  be a pure immediacy, but rather that the whole of the science be within itself 
  a circle in which the first is also the last and the last is also the first.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In other words: since logic, if 
  it is to be truly 'scientific', cannot be grounded in something external to 
  itself, it must, instead, ground itself- that is, demonstrate itself to be self-supporting. 
  This is why the form of Hegel's system is every bit as important as its content. 
  Philosophy progresses, as we have seen, not only by advancing from the fixed 
  starting-point of pure being, but also, in the same motion, by returning to 
  and grounding it- i.e. tracing the path of a circle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus the beginning of philosophy 
  is the foundation which is present and preserved throughout its entire subsequent 
  development- remaining completely immanent in its further determinations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Through this process, then, the 
  beginning loses the one-sidedness which attaches to it as something simply immediate 
  and abstract. It becomes something mediated, and hence the line of the scientific 
  advance becomes a circle. It also follows that because that which forms the 
  beginning is still undeveloped [and] devoid of content, it is not truly known 
  in the beginning. It is the science of logic in its whole compass which first 
  constitutes the completed knowledge of it with its developed content, and first 
  truly grounds that knowledge.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">'Dialectic', we may now say, is 
  the name for the 'scientific advance' which constitutes Hegel's 'way' of doing 
  philosophy. To name the method of philosophy 'dialectic', then, is not to distinguish 
  it from its content. Indeed, Hegel says, the method 'is not something distinct 
  from its object and content; for it is the inwardness of the content -the dialectic 
  which it possesses within itself- which is the mainspring of its advance.' Dialectic 
  is the 'simple rhythm' which guarantees the systematic nature of science and 
  the scientific nature of the system. It is the 'the soul of the structure', 
  the 'self-construing method', and ultimately 'the course of the subject matter 
  itself.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">How, then, we must ask, does dialectic 
  work? The best and perhaps only satisfactory way to answer this question is 
  to observe it in action. As an example, we shall turn to the beginning of logic 
  and examine the first and best-known of Hegel's logical presentations. Here, 
  as we have already seen, the first concept is said to be 'being'. Now thought, 
  as Hegel has explained, is supposed to produce itself, to proceed on its own- 
  and similarly to the opening of the Phenomenology, we find the statement: 'When 
  I think, I give up my subjective particularity, sink myself in the matter, let 
  thought follow its own course; and I think badly whenever I add something of 
  my own.' Philosophy, Hegel says, 'has to complete itself in a purely continuous 
  course in which nothing extraneous is introduced.' And in the Philosophy of 
  Right, he says specifically of dialectic that it</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>is not an external activity of 
  subjective thought, but the very soul of the content which puts forth its branches 
  and fruits organically. This development of the Idea as the activity of its 
  own rationality is something which thought -since it is subjective- merely observes 
  without, for its part, adding anything extra.</i></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Having considered these preliminary 
  remarks we must now return to logic's beginning for Hegel and ask how the mere 
  concept of 'being' can be capable of development on its own. How can a single 
  concept be shown to contain the potential for movement in itself? Hegel's famous 
  demonstration (described as 'breath-taking' by at least one commentator) proceeds 
  thus: If we consider 'Being, pure being, without any further determination', 
  we find that it is 'pure indeterminateness and emptiness.' Being, since it is 
  the logically first category and therefore the most general and abstract, can 
  be predicated of everything which can be said to be. Being is the one concept 
  which applies to everything. What this means, however, is not that 'being' -as 
  all-embracing- is the richest category, but rather the poorest. '[I]nstead of 
  absolute plenitude,' Hegel says, 'we have absolute emptiness.' Being's absolute 
  generality makes it impossible to distinguish the being of one thing from that 
  of another, for to employ a concept which is equally applicable to everything 
  is to say something which is at the same time nothing. For this reason Hegel 
  concludes: 'Being- the indeterminate immediate- is, in fact, nothing'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus we have arrived at the second 
  category of logic. 'Nothing, pure nothing', Hegel says, is 'complete emptiness, 
  absence of all determination and content- undifferentiatedness in itself.' To 
  speak thus of 'nothing', however, suggests that in addition to being opposed 
  to 'being', it is at the same time identical. 'Nothing is therefore the same 
  determination, or rather absence of determination, and thus altogether the same 
  as pure being.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We now have before us two concepts- 
  being and nothing- which are said to be simultaneously opposed and equivalent 
  to each other. In this unstable situation, being and nothing fluctuate and dissolve; 
  each contradicts the other, while at the same time transforming into it- or 
  rather not transforming into it [as many commentators erroneously suggest even 
  though Hegel himself expressly states: 'being does not pass over, but has [already] 
  passed over into nothing'. (See also NOTE below.)]</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What is the truth is neither being 
  nor nothing, but that being... has passed over into nothing, and nothing into 
  being. It is equally true, however... that they are absolutely distinct and 
  yet that they are unseparated and inseparable and that each immediately vanishes 
  in its opposite. Their truth, therefore, is this movement of the immediate vanishing 
  of the one in the other: becoming, a movement in which both are distinguished, 
  but by a difference which has equally immediately resolved itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: As alluded to in the Introduction, 
  it is an un-Hegelian distortion and therefore a mistake to discuss the above 
  process in terms of 'synthesis'- as in the treacherously well-known formula 
  'thesis-antithesis-synthesis'- which seems universally to be supposed to epitomize 
  the essence of Hegelian philosophy- even though never employed by Hegel himself. 
  To the contrary, in fact, in the Science of Logic, Hegel remarks: '[B]ecause 
  &quot;synthesis&quot; suggests more than anything else the sense of an external 
  bringing together of mutually external things already there, the name synthesis 
  -[and any notion of] &quot;synthetic unity&quot;- has rightly been dropped.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The idea behind logic's third category 
  is that to become is, at the same time, to be and not to be. To say that something 
  becomes is to say that it is something which is, but simultaneously is not, 
  because it is becoming something else. 'The truth of being and nothing is accordingly 
  the unity of the two: and this unity is becoming.' Becoming, then, represents 
  the truth of both being and nothing taken together; for, when each is considered 
  on its own- in its 'one-sidedness'- (as we saw above) this truth is absent (or 
  at least does not constitute an embodiment of the whole truth). As being 'vanishes' 
  into nothing, and nothing into being, so both of them vanish with what Hegel 
  calls their 'sublation' (Aufheben) into becoming- which, Hegel says, is 'the 
  vanishing of the vanishing itself'; it is their 'vanishedness'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel explicitly says that it is 
  not 'being' but having been which is to be grasped as 'becoming'. What has already 
  been is -as having been- a becoming; it must become what it already always was 
  and what it is; and when it has become, it is no longer characterized by the 
  immediacy of pure being with which we began, but is now determinate being, or 
  simply a being. In this way we have completed the first of the system's circles; 
  for we have started out from being and returned to it again at a higher, i.e. 
  more determinate and concrete level.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">On their own, being and nothing 
  negate each other in a relationship of contradiction; in becoming, this situation 
  can be seen to be reconciled. This is what Hegel means when he says that 'philosophy 
  does not stop at the merely negative result of dialectic... When dialectic has 
  the negative as its result, then -precisely as a result- this negative is at 
  the same time positive, for it contains what it resulted from reconciled within 
  itself, and cannot be without it.' (This, we will remember, is what Hegel regards 
  as his advance on Kant.) In more detail, we read:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">All that is necessary to achieve 
  scientific progress... is the recognition of the logical principle that the 
  negative is just as much positive, or that what is self-contradictory does not 
  resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only 
  into the negation of its particular content- in other words, that such a negation 
  is... the negation of a specific subject-matter which resolves itself and consequently 
  is a specific negation and therefore the outcome essentially contains that from 
  which it results... Because the result -the negation- is a specific negation 
  it has a content. It is a fresh notion, but higher and richer by the negation... 
  of the latter, [and it] therefore contains it, but also something more, and 
  is the unity of itself and its opposite. It is in this way that the system of 
  notions as such has to be formed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Dialectic, then -being the discovery 
  and reconciliation of contradiction within thought itself- is the method of 
  Hegel's philosophy; but it is not a method in the ordinary sense of being merely 
  a set of instructions externally applied to the subject-matter of one's choice. 
  Dialectic, Hegel says, 'constitutes the moving soul of scientific progression 
  and it is the principle through which alone immanent coherence and necessity 
  enter into the content of science'. Since it is 'the course of the subject-matter 
  itself' (rather that what we have seen Hegel call 'our own bright idea'), dialectic 
  does not result in anything which could be regarded as Hegel's own personal 
  philosophical preference, but instead- in philosophy as such.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">NOTE: On this point, Hegel clearly 
  opposes Fichte's idea [expressed in his Science of Knowledge (1794)] that 'what 
  sort of philosophy one chooses depends... on what sort of man one is; for a 
  philosophical system is not a dead piece of furniture which we can reject or 
  accept as we wish; it is rather a thing animated by the soul of the person who 
  holds it.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So dialectic cannot simply be regarded 
  as philosophy's method; for, as we shall now see, it is not only the way to 
  do philosophy [or, we could say (as Hegel himself does), the way philosophy 
  does itself], but also the source of both philosophy's form and content.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In the other sciences form and content 
  fall apart, but in philosophy thought is itself its own object. Thinking here 
  is preoccupied with itself and is self-determining; it realizes itself by determining 
  itself out of its own resources, and its vocation is to produce itself and exist 
  in that production. It is an inherent process; it is active and alive, has a 
  variety of relations within itself, and is self-differentiating. Thought is 
  simply the thinking which moves itself onwards.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If we return now to the being-nothing-becoming 
  triad, we will recall that Hegel's claim is that thought, merely by thinking, 
  provides philosophy with its beginning, i.e. the first thought. (Hegel goes 
  to great lengths to show that this self-determination is in fact what occurs- 
  that it is thought itself, rather than Hegel thinking which produces logic's 
  starting-point.) Next, our reflection on 'being' activates dialectic- thus generating 
  being's opposite: nothing, which also turns out, as we saw, to be identical 
  to it. The flux and tension of this unstable coupling is then relieved by logic's 
  third category: becoming. Next arise determinate being (the becoming which 'has 
  become'), quality ('determinateness which is'), and so on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>In the absolute method, the Concept 
  maintains itself in its otherness -the universal in its particularization- in 
  judgement and reality; at each stage of its further determination it raises 
  the entire mass of its preceding content, and by its dialectical advance it 
  not only does not lose anything or leave anything behind, but carries along 
  with it all it has gained, and inwardly enriches and consolidates itself. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we witness here, as we have 
  seen, is not a mere linear progression, but instead a circular return. Simply 
  put: the circle is the form which the content gives to itself through the operation 
  of dialectic; and dialectic, Hegel says, is nothing more than 'the consciousness 
  of the form of the inner self-movement of the content'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this self-determining circularity 
  lies the key to 'absolute knowing', i.e. the 'infinity' of Hegel's philosophy. 
  By 'infinite', however, Hegel does not mean 'the opposite of finitude' (i.e. 
  the non- or 'un-finite')- which goes on forever without end, but instead infinity 
  as a self-contained whole- not opposed to the finite, but holding the totality 
  of finitude within itself. Hegel would say that the ordinary conception of infinity 
  is really that of the un-finite: what is finite is limited- it exists up to 
  a certain point, while infinity is unlimited and goes on forever. This un-finite, 
  however, is not the 'true' infinite, but instead: false or 'bad' infinity, because, 
  to Hegel it is not infinite at all. The un-finite is merely an endless process 
  of continuously adding finite elements to each other. But in this way, finitude 
  is never transcended and infinity achieved. The un-finite may thus be thought 
  of as the straight line which extends forever in one direction- while the truly 
  infinite line, as we have seen, is the one which returns to itself and forms 
  a circle; it has neither beginning nor end, but is, at the same time, finite. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">To call infinity 'finite' in this 
  way means, on Hegel's terms, that it has a limit- which may, at first, seem 
  paradoxical. But the contradiction vanishes when we realize that infinity's 
  limit is only that which it gives to itself. Hegel explains:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>'[F]inite' means whatever comes 
  to an end, what is, but ceases to be where it connects with its other, and is 
  thus restricted by it. Hence, the finite subsists in relation to its other- 
  which is its negation, and presents itself as its limit. But thinking is at 
  home with itself, it relates itself to itself, and is its own object. Insofar 
  as my object is a thought, I am at home with myself. Thus the 'I' or thinking, 
  is infinite because it is related in thinking to an object which is itself. 
  An object as such is an other, something negative which confronts me. But if 
  thinking thinks itself then it has an object which is at the same time not an 
  object, i.e. an object which is reconciled with it, [or] 'ideal'. Thus thinking 
  as such -thinking in its purity- does not have any restriction within itself.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thinking is only finite insofar 
  as it stays within restricted determinations which it holds to be ultimate. 
  Infinite or 'speculative' thinking, on the contrary, makes determinations likewise, 
  but, in determining -in limiting- it overcomes this defect again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we have seen, Hegel's philosophy 
  forms a circle and, as such, constitutes 'infinite' or 'absolute' knowing. Hegel 
  would claim that along the path of this circle we should find every determination 
  of though, nature, and mind- each in its proper place and relation to the others 
  and the whole. Being a circle, it is both finite and infinite- it is limited 
  and self-contained, but its limit is its own self. Hegel's system, then, is 
  a finite body of thought, but as its scope encompass both thought and nature, 
  nothing remains 'left over' to limit it from outside. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">We have now seen how philosophy 
  is genuinely 'scientific' in beginning without presuppositions and advancing 
  in accordance with its own immanent dialectic. We have also seen how the path 
  of this advance takes the shape of a circle and returns to itself as its own 
  ground. And finally, we saw how this circular structure enables the philosopher 
  to achieve an infinite point of view and thus accommodate the infinity of his 
  proper subject-matter- the absolute. What remains now to do is to consider briefly 
  precisely how dialectic functions, and the consequences of this upon knowing 
  itself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The motor behind dialectic is, in 
  a word, contradiction. The contradiction in things is revealed to us when we 
  set out to comprehend the world through the cognitive faculty of 'the understanding'. 
  Hegel says: 'In ordinary consciousness, we see nothing wrong with the finite 
  determinations of thought; they are held to be valid without further question. 
  But all our illusions arise from thinking and acting according to finite determinations.' 
  Hegel's point is that the understanding is 'analytic', and, as such, goes about 
  its business through the application of abstract, finite thought-determinations 
  or 'categories' to the objects of the world. In this mode of cognition, he says, 
  we take the categories 'to be valid on their own account, and capable of being 
  predicates of what is true', when they are, in fact, only 'restricted determinations 
  of the understanding which express only a restriction.' For this reason, the 
  result of the understanding's activity is merely what Hegel calls 'external 
  reflection'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The presupposition of the understanding's 
  activity, Hegel says, is 'that of na‹ve belief generally, namely, that thinking 
  grasps what things are in-themselves, that things only are what they genuinely 
  are when they are [captured] in thought.' The idea is that the understanding 
  thinks it can know the truth of things simply through determining them with 
  its categories. But, Hegel warns, if 'we proceed by way of predication, the 
  mind gets the feeling that the predicates cannot exhaust what they are attached 
  to.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The understanding, in its pigeon-holing 
  process, keeps the necessity and notion of the content to itself- all that constitutes 
  the concreteness, the actuality, the living movement of the reality which it 
  arranges. Or rather it does not keep this to itself since it does not recognize 
  it; for if it had this insight it would surely give some sign of it. It does 
  not even recognize the need for it, else it would drop schematizing, or at least 
  realize that it can never hope to learn more in this fashion that one learns 
  from a [mere] table of contents. A table of contents is all that it offers [while] 
  the content itself it does not offer at all.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If, on the other hand, Hegel argues, 
  we are to have '[g]enuine cognition of an object,' we must 'allow the object 
  to determine itself freely from within'. This cognitive attitude brings us back 
  to 'speculative reason'- Hegel's 'altogether new concept of scientific procedure'; 
  for in determining itself, thinking is not limited by the 'products of the lifeless 
  understanding and external cognition' 'whose restrictions count... as something 
  fixed, that would not be negated again.' 'In the case of finite things,' Hegel 
  says, 'it is certainly true that they must be determined by means of finite 
  predicates, and here the understanding with its activity has its proper place. 
  Being itself finite [however], the understanding is cognizant only of the nature 
  of the finite.' But '[t]he objects of reason cannot be determined through such 
  finite predicates'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Reason -or 'speculation'- is self-determining, 
  and thus -in transcending the finitude of the understanding- is truly infinite.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>When we are discussing thinking, 
  we must distinguish finite thinking -the thinking of the mere understanding- 
  from the infinite thinking of reason. Taken in isolation, just as they are immediately 
  given, thought-determinations are finite determinations. But what is true is 
  what is infinite within itself; it cannot be expressed and brought to consciousness 
  through what is finite.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's problem with the understanding, 
  then, is simply its finitude. Since 'what is true is what is infinite within 
  itself' -and therefore cannot be cognized through finite thinking- thought must 
  rise to the occasion- that is, it must itself become infinite. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel is aware, however, as he says, 
  that 'the expression &quot;infinite thinking&quot; may appear quite astonishing. 
  But, in fact, thinking is', he claims, 'inwardly and essentially infinite'- 
  as we have already seen him explain- i.e. in terms of though 'thinking (and 
  therefore determining) itself'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">What we have now seen is Hegel's 
  explanation of why and how thought passes on from the finite realm of the understanding 
  to the infinity of reason. But even though the understanding is unable to comprehend 
  the absolute, it is, nonetheless, Hegel admits, 'indispensable' and 'must unquestionably 
  be conceded its right and merit'. '[I]t scarcely requires special mention', 
  he continues, 'that philosophy cannot do without the understanding. Philosophising 
  requires, above all that each thought should be grasped in its full precision, 
  and that nothing should remain vague and indeterminate.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[I]n theory, knowledge begins 
  [with the understanding] by apprehending existing objects in their specific 
  differences... Thought is here acting in its 'analytic' capacity, where its 
  canon is identity, a simple reference of each attribute to itself... But... 
  the understanding must not go too far... [it] cannot have the last word. On 
  the contrary, it is finite- and more precisely it is such that when it is pushed 
  to an extreme, it overturns into its opposite. It is the way of youth to toss 
  about in abstractions, whereas the man of experience does not get caught up 
  in the abstract either-or, but holds onto the concrete.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 'concrete' is provided by speculative 
  reason. Speculation is, as Hegel says, the recognition that 'everything actual 
  contains opposed determinations within it, and in consequence, the cognition 
  and, more exactly, the comprehension of an object amounts precisely to our becoming 
  conscious of it as a concrete unity of opposed determinations.' Thus, what speculative 
  thinking reveals is 'dialectic' itself- which Hegel calls</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the principle of all motion, 
  of all life, and of all activation in the actual world. Equally, dialectic is 
  the soul of all genuinely scientific cognition. In our ordinary consciousness, 
  not stopping at the abstract determinations of the understanding appears as 
  simple fairness, in accordance with the proverb 'live and let live', so that 
  one thing holds and the other does also. But a closer look shows that the finite 
  is not restricted merely from the outside; rather, it overcomes itself by virtue 
  of its own nature, and passes over, of itself, into its opposite. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Earlier, we saw that finitude was 
  characterized by external negation- that is, to be finite entailed being 'negated' 
  or opposed by something other. But here we see Hegel taking a further step: 
  the finite is now seen to limit itself and 'pass over into its opposite'. This 
  occurs, Hegel explains, because dialectic 'is concerned precisely with considering 
  things [as they are] in and for themselves, so that the finitude of the one-sided 
  determinations of the understanding becomes evident.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's point is that the rigidity 
  of the understanding provides the starting point for thought's dialectical developments- 
  while the second, negative, stage, that of the dialectic itself- the 'dialectical 
  moment'- is achieved when reflection reveals that the understanding's categories, 
  because fixed, finite, and 'one-sided', entail contradictions. In other words: 
  in 'passing into their opposites', thought-determinations dialectically generate 
  their own negations which seem now to stand separate and opposed to them. Of 
  this process, Hegel says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Dialectic is usually considered 
  as an external art, which arbitrarily produces a confusion and a mere semblance 
  of contradictions in determinate concepts... According to its proper determinacy, 
  however, dialectic is the genuine nature that properly belongs to the determinations 
  of the understanding, to things, and to the finite in general... [It] is the 
  immanent transcending, in which the one-sidedness and restrictedness of the 
  determinations of the understanding displays itself as what it is, i.e., as 
  their negation. That is what everything finite is: its own sublation. Hence 
  dialectic constitutes the moving soul of scientific progression, and it is the 
  principle through which alone immanent coherence and necessity enter into the 
  content of science, just as all genuine, non-external elevation above the finite 
  is to be found in this principle. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">If knowledge of the absolute is 
  to be had, then, it cannot arise through the understanding. To attempt to characterize 
  the infinite in terms of the fixed categories of the understanding is not to 
  cognize it, but, instead, as we have seen, merely to impose a limit upon it. 
  As Hegel says: indeed, 'infinity is sharply contrasted with finitude, yet it 
  is easy to see that if the two are set against one another, then infinity, which 
  is nevertheless supposed to be the whole, appears as one side only, and is limited 
  by the finite. But a limited infinity is [of course] itself only something finite.' 
  In this way, thought's dialectic machinery is activated, and contradiction produced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The result of dialectic's 'scientific 
  progression' and 'elevation above the finite' is, Hegel explains, the achievement 
  of a third positive and therefore higher category: that of the 'speculation'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The speculative or positively 
  rational apprehends the unity of determinations in their opposition- the affirmative 
  that is contained in their dissolution and in their transition.</i></font></p>
<p><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(1) The dialectic has a positive 
  result because it has a determinate content, or because its result is truly 
  not an empty, abstract nothing, but the negation of certain determinations which 
  are contained in the result precisely because it is not an immediate nothing 
  but a result. </font></i></p>
<p><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">(2) Hence this rational [result] 
  -although it is something thought and something abstract- is at the same time 
  something concrete, because it is not simple, formal unity, but a unity of distinct 
  determinations. For this reason, philosophy does not deal with mere abstractions 
  or formal thoughts at all, but only with concrete thoughts. </font></i></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus, speculation not only reconciles 
  the contradiction present at the level of dialectic, but also, in doing so, 
  preserves the one-sided 'half-truths' which its components presented. Speculation, 
  Hegel says, 'contains the very antitheses at which the understanding stops short... 
  resolved within itself; and precisely for this reason it proves to be concrete 
  and a totality... [which] cannot be expressed in a one-sided proposition.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel's system of logic is the explicit 
  demonstration of speculative philosophy- that is, of the overcoming of fixed 
  thought determinations, and therefore the way to infinite knowledge. (This differs 
  from the 'absolute knowing' of the Phenomenology in being the development of 
  pure thought rather than that of the experience of consciousness.) Just as logic's 
  first triad -being-nothing-becoming- exemplifies the dialectic of speculation, 
  as it were, in a nutshell, so does the overall structure of logic as a whole 
  (only this time in a much larger nutshell): Being-Essence-Concept. This comprehensive 
  triad, like its primary model, begins with Being (which itself begins with the 
  pure being of the first triad), and returns to it as well in the form of the 
  absolute idea- a process which we shall briefly consider here before moving 
  on to Chapter Two.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As we have heard already, the first 
  of logic's two 'books' -the 'objective' logic—comprises the doctrines of Being 
  and Essence—the significance of which we have already encountered in a slightly 
  different form in our consideration of the Phenomenology. Being represents thought's 
  attempt to grasp the objective structure of what is—discovering within its thought 
  of ‘being’ a multiplicity of inter-dependent beings: quality, quantity, measure, 
  etc. Thought's ultimate discovery in this doctrine is that these individual 
  beings and their relations in fact constitute the essence of Being, and thus, 
  Hegel says, thought realizes that '[t]he truth of Being is Essence.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Since knowing has for its goal 
  knowledge of the true... it does not stop at the immediate and its determinations, 
  but penetrates it on the supposition that at the back of this Being there is 
  something else- something other than Being itself, that this background constitutes 
  the truth of Being. This knowledge is a mediated knowing- for it is not found 
  immediately with and in Essence, but starts from an other -from Being- and has 
  a preliminary path to tread- that of going beyond Being, or rather of penetrating 
  into it. Not until knowing inwardizes, recollects itself out of immediate being 
  does it, through this mediation, find Essence. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this way, 'Being inwardizes itself 
  through its own nature, and through this movement into itself, becomes Essence.' 
  'If, therefore, the absolute was at first defined as Being, now it is defined 
  as Essence.'. Knowing now knows the absolute as 'Essence' because it realizes 
  that the Being with which it began 'presupposes', Hegel says, 'an internalization, 
  a recollection and movement which has purified immediate, determinant being 
  to pure being. Being is accordingly determined as Essence- as a being in which 
  everything determinate and finite is negated.' 'Essence', then, conceptually 
  speaking, may be seen, Hegel says, as: 'a product- an artefact' because it is 
  realized or created by the mind. It is also, Hegel says, that which 'stands 
  between Being and the Concept; it constitutes their mean, and its movement is 
  the transition from Being into the Concept.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Hegel calls the 'doctrine of the 
  Concept' the 'System of Subjective Logic'—thereby alluding to its content—which 
  in many ways conforms more to what we might expect to find in a logic text-book. 
  Thus we find sub-sections concerning: induction, judgement, syllogism, and other 
  standard logical forms. These, however, all occur under the heading of 'Subjectivity', 
  while under 'Objectivity' we find such unexpected terms as: 'chemism', 'teleology', 
  'life', and the ‘absolute idea’. Of ordinary logic, Hegel remarks that 'a completely 
  ready-made and solidified—one may say ossified—material is already to hand, 
  and the problem is to render this material fluid and to re-kindle the spontaneity 
  of the Concept in such dead matter.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>[T]he Concept is to be regarded 
  in the first instance simply as the third to Being and Essence- to the immediate 
  and to reflection. Being and Essence are so far the moments of its becoming; 
  but it is their foundation and truth as the identity in which they are submerged 
  and contained. They are contained in it because it is their result.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Thus, Being and Essence, Hegel says, 
  as 'objective' logic, constitute 'the genetic exposition of [the 'subjective' 
  logic of] the Concept'. But the Concept, 'in its formal abstraction', Hegel 
  continues,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>reveals itself as incomplete, 
  and through its own immanent dialectic passes over into reality; but it does 
  not fall back again onto a ready-made reality confronting it and take refuge 
  in something which has shown itself to be the unessential element of appearance 
  because, having looked around for something better, it has failed to find it; 
  on the contrary, it produces the reality from its own resources.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Through 'Essence' we have already 
  seen that the world as it appears to immediate consciousness is not reality 
  as such, but merely appearance. Therefore, thought cannot simply 'take refuge' 
  in what it takes to be apparent reality—which, with the first category of Essence, 
  Hegel calls: 'illusory being'—but instead must find for itself what is true 
  and 'absolute'. Thus, the doctrine of Essence can be seen as thought's elevation 
  of itself both out of the 'one-sided' immediacy of Being (since what is true 
  is not simply what is there), and also out of the equally one-sided view of 
  Essence that what is true is what is not there- that is, what 'stands behind' 
  appearances and constitutes their essence. Essence, then, is the becoming of 
  the Concept—which, in turn, Hegel says, is </font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>the unity of Being and Essence. 
  Essence is the first negation of being—which has thereby become illusory being; 
  the Concept is the second negation, or the negation of this negation, and is 
  therefore being once more—but being that has been restored as the infinite mediation 
  and negativity of being within itself.' </i></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Being and Essence, however are no 
  longer to be thought of as Being and Essence; nor, Hegel says, 'are they merely 
  in a [simple] unity'; for now, he continues, 'the Concept does not differentiate 
  itself into these determinations'. '[T]he different moments of the Concept are 
  themselves the whole Concept'. 'This, now, is the very concept of the Concept', 
  Hegel says, adding, however, that this 'concept of the Concept' 'is as yet only 
  its concept; or this concept is itself only the Concept [itself].' What Hegel 
  is trying to prepare us for is the Concept not as a mere concept, but as 'the 
  Idea'. The Concept as such, he says 'is not yet complete, but must rise to the 
  Idea which alone is the unity of the Concept and reality.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So at first the Concept—still as 
  Concept and not yet Idea—is, as Hegel says, 'only in itself or implicitly the 
  truth... it is only something inner'. For this reason, the Concept is merely 
  'something posited or subjective' - which reminds us that -like logic itself 
  as a whole- the doctrine of the Concept has two parts: subjective and objective. 
  The contents of the 'subjective' part of 'subjective logic', then, conform to 
  our ordinary expectations of logic, and fall under the three headings of: 'Concept', 
  'Judgement', and 'Syllogism'. Constituting the structure of thought, the 'inner 
  or subjective essence' of these forms, Hegel says, 'sets them dialectically 
  in movement- with the result that their separateness vanishes, and with it, 
  the separation of the Concept from the object; and there emerges as their truth 
  the totality which is the objective Concept.' 'Through its necessary, progressive 
  determination, the formal Concept [now &quot;objective&quot;] makes itself its 
  subject-matter, and in this way is rid of the relation of subjectivity and externality 
  to the object [and is thus free].'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>But this freedom is still only 
  an immediate -[that is] not yet a negative- freedom. As one with the object, 
  the Concept is submerged in it; its distinct moments are objective existences 
  in which it is itself again only the inner. As the soul of objective reality, 
  it must give itself the form of subjectivity which, as formal ['subjective'] 
  Concept, belonged to it immediately; thus in the form of the free Concept -a 
  form which, in objectivity it still lacked- it opposes itself to that objectivity, 
  and, in so doing, makes the identity with it which, as objective Concept, it 
  possesses... as a posited identity.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In other words, the Concept must 
  now show itself to be related to something else—that is, to the 'formal', 'subjective' 
  Concept it was originally—as subject to object now 'posited' as an identity. 
  In this 'consummation', as Hegel calls it,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>in which it [i.e. the Concept] 
  has the form of freedom, even in its objectivity- the adequate Concept is the 
  Idea. Reason, which is the sphere of the Idea, is the self-revealed truth in 
  which the Concept possesses the realization that is wholly adequate to it, and 
  is free inasmuch as it cognizes this its objective world in its subjectivity, 
  and its subjectivity in its objective world.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This is what Hegel means when he 
  says that 'the Idea is the unity of the Concept and objectivity'. He now adds 
  to this, however, that the Idea 'must not be regarded merely as a goal to which 
  we have to approximate, but which [at the same time] itself always remains a 
  kind of beyond; on the contrary, we must recognize that everything actual is 
  only in so far as it possesses the Idea and expresses it.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Now the Idea has shown itself 
  to be the Concept liberated again into its subjectivity from the immediacy in 
  which it is submerged in the object; to be the Concept which distinguishes itself 
  from its objectivity- which, however, is no less determined by it and possesses 
  its substantiality only in that Concept.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This final sphere of logic -'The 
  Idea'- has three chapters: 'Life', 'The Idea of Cognition', and 'The Absolute 
  Idea'. 'Life', Hegel admits, 'is concerned with a subject-matter so concrete 
  and, if you will, so real, that with it we may seem to have over-stepped the 
  domain of logic'; but, he explains, it is certainly no dead, nor even merely 
  organic object in which the Concept can know itself to be the Concept, and thereby 
  constitute the Idea; first there must be life: 'the immediate Idea', and since, 
  as Hegel says, 'the truth as such exists essentially in cognition', that life 
  must not only be conscious, but also capable of thought- bringing us to the 
  second chapter on cognition. 'Thinking, mind, self-consciousness- [these] are 
  [the] determinations of the Idea where it has itself for [its] object' 'The 
  Concept, when it has developed into a concrete existence that is itself free, 
  is none other than the I or pure self-consciousness.' In other words: the 'I' 
  is that which unifies thought and being- it is the thought which is being, and 
  the being which is thought.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Logic, as we know,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>exhibits itself as a circle returning 
  upon itself- the end being wound back into the beginning -the simple ground- 
  by the mediation; this circle is moreover a circle of circles- for each individual 
  member, as ensouled by the method, is reflected into itself so that in returning 
  into the beginning it is, at the same time, the beginning of a new member.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Logic ends with the absolute idea, 
  or the Idea which knows itself- which, as we have seen, is the self itself. 
  What the self knows is what is there confronting it, or the world- which is 
  the subject of the next sphere, the philosophy of nature- with which the self 
  is 'reconciled' through the historical development of self-consciousness in 
  the third part of Hegel's system: the philosophy of mind. Thus, Hegel says, 
  logic,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>in the absolute idea, has withdrawn 
  into that same simple unity which its beginning is; the pure immediacy of being 
  in which, at first, every determination appears to be extinguished or removed 
  by abstraction is the Idea that has reached through mediation -that is, through 
  the sublation of mediation- a likeness correspondent to itself.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">At the end of logic in the Encyclop‘dia, 
  Hegel says:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>When one speaks of the absolute 
  idea, one can assume that here the truth finally comes out, and that everything 
  is brought forth. One can make all sorts of empty declarations about the absolute 
  idea, [but] its true content, however, is none other than the entire system 
  whose development we have observed up to this point. </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">So now at the end we may say that 
  in the absolute idea we have preserved all of logic as it has developed and 
  unfolded itself up to this final comprehensive point. We have also seen how 
  this result is at the same time a return to its beginning in pure being (though 
  now fully comprehended). What remains to indicate here is how in addition, the 
  absolute idea, 'as the final result, becomes also the beginning of another sphere 
  and science.' This is where the Idea, Hegel says, 'resolves to let the moment 
  of its particularity... as its reflected image, go forth freely as nature.' 
  At this point, we have left the pure thought of logic behind for the externality 
  of space and time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>The Idea, namely, in positing 
  itself as the absolute unity of the pure Concept and its reality, and thus contracting 
  itself into the immediacy of being [i.e. returning to that with which logic 
  began], is the totality in this form—nature. But this determination has not 
  issued from a process of becoming, nor is it a transition, as when the subjective 
  Concept, in its totality, becomes objectivity.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this passage we can see (as we 
  saw above with 'becoming' and 'synthesis') that another of the greatest problems 
  with Hegel's philosophy -logic's 'transition' into nature- is in reality a problem 
  only for those who (for whatever reason) are more interested in criticizing 
  Hegel than taking the time to read him. Following what Hegel actually says we 
  can see clearly that it is anything but a 'transition' of thought into nature 
  which occurs at the end of logic. 'The passage [of thought into nature] is to 
  be understood here rather in this manner: that the Idea freely releases itself 
  in its absolute self assurance and inner poise.' (The Idea, we will remember, 
  is, Hegel says, 'none other than the I or pure self-consciousness'- meaning 
  that it is not some disembodied thought or mind which somehow becomes or turns 
  into nature, but instead, it is our own thought which turns outward to consider 
  philosophically the structure of the world we in which we live and interact 
  with. The 'shift', in other words, is in our thinking—that is, from the thinking 
  about thought which is the subject of logic, to thinking about nature.) In this 
  ‘resolve of the pure Idea to determine itself as external Idea’, Hegel says,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>it thereby only posits for itself 
  the mediation [which is nature itself] out of which the Concept ascends as a 
  free existence that has withdrawn into itself from externality, that completes 
  its self-liberation in the science of mind, and which finds the supreme concept 
  of itself in the science of logic as the self-comprehending pure Concept.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In this brief statement, Hegel has 
  expressed the complete meaning of his system as a 'circle of circles'- that 
  is, how nature mediates the logical development of pure thought and historical 
  unfolding of spirit- to which we now turn as it manifests itself in art and 
  its history.</font></p>
