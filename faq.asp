            Q: &quot;What is tea?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Tea is the common name of <i>Camellia 
            sinensis</i> -the &quot;Chinese Camellia&quot;- a flowering evergreen 
            shrub native to southern China. &quot;Tea&quot; is also the name of 
            the processed dry leaves of this shrub and the infused beverage produced 
            by soaking these leaves in hot water. This means that different tea 
            varieties, i.e. green tea, oolong, etc., are all derived from the 
            same plant (see question 2) and, further, that &quot;herbal tea&quot; 
            is a misnomer since tea itself is an herb and any other herbs, therefore, 
            are not tea.</font><br>

            <a name="section2"></a><b>2.<i> Q: &quot;How is tea made?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">As noted in question 1 above, all 
            tea comes from the tea plant, <i>Camellia sinensis</i>, so the major 
            differences we see between the various tea families and styles cannot 
            be attributed to botanical distinctions (although some do exist, i.e. 
            Assam and Cambodian varieties). Instead, it is mainly the way tea 
            is processed that results in its wide variety. Unlike most other herbs, 
            which are simply picked and dried, tea goes through many distinct 
            stages of processing between harvest and infusion. <i>GREEN</i> tea 
            is (generally speaking) processed least, usually undergoing only 2 
            or 3 processes, as follows. After plucking, the leaves are allowed 
            to &quot;wither&quot;, during which time they loose some of their 
            moisture content, becoming soft and fragrant. Next, they are heated 
            (e.g. by steaming or pan-firing) in order to prevent oxidation and 
            preserve their green color and fresh flavor. This heating may dry 
            the tea completely, or the leaves may be shaped (e.g. by rolling) 
            before final drying. <i>OOLONG</i> and <i>BLACK</i> tea undergo additional 
            processing (such as shaking, tumbling or crushing) which bruises or 
            breaks open the surface of the leaf in order to encourage oxidation. 
            During oxidation (also erroneously known as &quot;fermentation&quot;), 
            enzymes exposed to the air cause the leaf to darken, thus developing 
            the tea's color, aroma, and flavor. Upon achieving the desired level 
            of oxidation, the process is halted by heating and drying.</font><br>

            <a name="section3"></a><b>3.<i> Q: &quot;What do tea names mean?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Tea names can tell us a lot about 
            a tea. &quot;West Lake Dragon Well&quot;, &quot;Formosa Oolong&quot;, 
            and &quot;Anxi Tieguanyin&quot;, for example, identify the teas' places 
            of origin, i.e. the West Lake of China's ancient capital Hangzhou, 
            Formosa (the Portuguese name for Taiwan), and mountainous Anxi county 
            in Fujian province. In addition, &quot;Dragon Well&quot; and &quot;Tieguanyin&quot; 
            allude to legends associated with particular teas, such as a dragon 
            spring near Hangzhou or a goddess named Guanyin. Tea names can also 
            contain clues about shape, color, and texture, such as &quot;&quot;Pearl&quot;, 
            &quot;Silver Needle&quot;, &quot;Jade&quot;, &quot;White Hair&quot;, 
            and so on.</font><br>

            <br>
            <a name="section4"></a><b>4.<i> Q: &quot;How is tea flavored?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Throughout its history, the flavor 
            of tea has been enhanced by a variety of aromatic substances. In modern 
            tea processing, this tradition continues under two major headings: 
            &quot;scenting&quot; and &quot;flavoring&quot;. (A third category, 
            really a form of blending, involves mixing aromatic material into 
            the tea leaves, as in the case of chai, which is made by adding spice 
            to the tea.) Two of the world's most popular teas are jasmine and 
            Earl Grey - perfect examples of scenting and flavoring. Jasmine is 
            (or, at least, should be) a <i><b>scented</b></i> tea, meaning that 
            all that is added to the tea is literally the scent. This is how it 
            works: tea leaves are picked, processed, and dried. Then they are 
            &quot;layered&quot; with jasmine flowers, i.e. stacked in thin layers 
            of tea leaves and jasmine flowers separated by screens. For high quality 
            teas, such as Jasmine Pearls, the flowers are changed several times 
            and the scenting process can last up to a week. (Jasmine flowers are 
            mixed in with lower quality products for show, but they only contribute 
            negatively to the flavor since jasmine flowers themselves do not have 
            a pleasant taste.) Flavored teas are a much simpler affair. They are 
            teas to which flavor has been added - in the case of Earl Grey, oil 
            of bergamot, a Mediterranean citrus fruit.</font><br>

            <a name="section5"></a><b>5.<i> Q: &quot;Why is some tea blended?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Blending is a process with a long 
            history in the tea business. Since quality can vary greatly from season 
            to season and place to place, blending was developed to improve product 
            consistency. Big commercial tea companies can use 30 different teas 
            or more to insure customers get the same flavor, aroma, and color 
            cup after cup, year after year. Blending also serves to &quot;round 
            out&quot; teas not considered &quot;self drinkers&quot; (i.e. teas 
            not good enough to drink on their own).</font><br>

            <br>
            <a name="section6"></a><b>6.<i> Q: &quot;How much caffeine is in tea?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Caffeine is a natural component of 
            the tea leaf, and, unless artificially removed, it is present to some 
            extent in all tea. By comparison, it should be noted that tea in general 
            contains significantly less caffeine than coffee (as little as &frac12;). 
            Most research suggests that the more oxidized (i.e. darker) a tea 
            is, the more caffeine it contains, but many other factors, such as 
            leaf size, water temperature and steeping time, are just as important 
            (making useful generalizations about the content and effect of caffeine 
            in tea nearly impossible). It can be said, however, that unlike coffee, 
            tea is known not only for its stimulating effect, but also for its 
            calming and soothing properties... making the only real test of any 
            particular tea's caffeine potency to brew it using your preferred 
            method and try it yourself.</font><br>

            <a name="section7"></a><b>7.<i> Q: &quot;What is Puerh tea?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">In terms of processing (and just about 
            every other way, too), Puerh is a special case, not conforming to 
            the methods outlined in the answer to question 2 above. Puerh, named 
            for a trade city in China's southwestern Yunnan province, is unique 
            in undergoing a stage of genuine <i><b>fermentation</b></i> during 
            manufacture. To achieve this, the tea leaves are heaped into dense 
            piles. In a process similar to the microbiology of wine and beer making 
            -which employ bacteria and yeast- Puerh tea is fermented with mold. 
            When the desired color, aroma, and flavor have developed, the mold 
            is carefully removed to prevent spoiling. &quot;Green&quot; (or &quot;raw&quot;) 
            Puerh tea is not fermented. It is sun-dried and allowed to oxidize 
            naturally over a long period (many years if possible). Puerh tea is 
            known not only for its uniquely rich, earthy flavor, but also for 
            its potent medicinal properties (generally related to the reduction 
            of cholesterol and blood fats) and the fact that rather than becoming 
            stale and tasteless as it ages, its flavor actually develops and improves- 
            meaning that, like a fine wine it can be aged 10, 20, 50 years or 
            more. Traditionally a popular tea in China, Puerh has recently begun 
            to find favor abroad- which is why Tribute Tea has taken care to assemble 
            a comprehensive collection of Puerh including superior examples of 
            many of its numerous loose, compressed, and aged varieties.</font><br>

            <a name="section8"></a><b>8.<i> Q: &quot;What are the health benefits 
            of tea?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">Scientific research suggests that 
            tea is beneficial to health in many significant ways:<br>
            <i><b>Cardiovascular</b></i> - Epidemiological studies have shown 
            a correlation between drinking black tea and lower incidence of heart 
            disease, probably because the polyphenols in tea prevent the peroxidation 
            of low-density lipoproteins (LDL or &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;), 
            which is the precipitating factor in the development of arterial plaque. 
            <br>
            <i><b>Anticancer</b></i> - Although epidemiological studies remain 
            inconclusive, laboratory studies strongly suggest that tea inhibits 
            tumor growth. It has definite antioxidant properties, although there 
            may be other reasons for its effect. Most research has focused on 
            the prevention of lung, throat, and gastrointestinal cancers, but 
            evidence also suggests a positive effect on skin and liver cancer.<br>
            <i><b>Nutritional</b></i> - Puerh and oolong teas have been shown 
            to lower cholesterol levels, although green tea has not been shown 
            to have the same effect. Tea may also protect teeth, as it can contain 
            fluoride, as well as inhibit glucosyltransferase, the enzyme that 
            helps bacteria adhere to teeth, thus leading to tooth decay.</font><br>

            <a name="section9"></a><b>9.<i> Q: &quot;What was the 'Boston Tea 
            Party'?&quot;</i></b><br>
            <b>A:</b> <font color="#000000">The first tea exported from Asia to 
            Europe was brought to Holland by the Dutch East India Company in about 
            1610. By 1650, tea had reached the new world, again with the help 
            of the Dutch, who introduced the exotic medicinal beverage (and their 
            customs of imbibing it) to the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (later 
            renamed New York after taken by the British). In 1767, Britain passed 
            the <a href="http://ahp.gatech.edu/townshend_act_1767.html" target="_blank">Townshend 
            Act</a>, which set the tax on tea at 3 pence per pound. In 1773, the 
            <a href="http://ahp.gatech.edu/tea_act_bp_1773.html" target="_blank">Tea 
            Act</a> appeared, which did not repeal the 3 pence tax, but allowed 
            surplus tea to be imported directly to the colonies at a lower price. 
            To the colonists, however, it was still &quot;taxation without representation&quot;. 
            In Boston, three British ships in the harbor were prevented from unloading 
            their cargo of tea. On the night of December 16, 1773, colonists dressed 
            as Mohawk Indians boarded the ships, broke open over 300 chests of 
            tea and proceded to dump the contents overboard. Similar &quot;tea 
            parties&quot; ensued in other parts of the colonies. Following the 
            Boston Tea Party, Britain issued the so-called &quot;Intolerable&quot; 
            or &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts" target="_blank">Coercive&quot; 
            Acts</a>, which, among other things, closed Boston Harbor, forced 
            the colonists to quarter British troops, and outlawed unsanctioned 
            public meetings. The Intolerable Acts united the colonies against 
            Britain, precipitated the convening of the the First Continental Congress, 
            and led ultimately to the American War of Independence.</font><br>

              a snack. When food is accompanying tea (rather than the other way
