Below is a detailed information about this program. For a quick start:
1. Copy counter.exe and gifs directory into your CGI-BIN directory.
2. Just add <img src=/cgi-bin/counter.exe?index.html align="right">
to your html file.

It is just that easy!

The Most Recent Version
-----------------------
Always get the most recent version from:
URL:    http://www.he.net/~bbsbs/behold/counter.html
FTP:    ftp://ftp.tdl.com/pub/kathey/behold/cntr???.zip
        Server:    ftp.tdl.com
        Directory: /pub/kathey/behold
        File:      cntr???.zip


What Is It?
-----------
This application can be used in HTML to count and display the number
of times a page has been accessed.  This is a Windows NT (32-bit) Console
Application.


Installation
------------
The easiest way is to unzip this archive in your cgi-bin using the "-d"
command.  This will put everything where it belongs.

1. Place the executable (counter.exe) and the Counter-Counter-Terrorism GIF
    (cct.gif) in your cgi-bin directory.
2. Copy all the counter GIFs (0default.gif, 1default.gif, ...) into a
    subdirectory of your cgi-bin named "cntrgifs".  Place any additional
    GIF digits here as well.


Instructions
------------
Always start with a very simple counter and then build it up to what you
want.  Your first HTML piece should look something like this:

<img src=/cgi-bin/counter.exe?home.html>

If this doesn't work, you will have to look carefully at how you have things
setup.


Usage
-----
Usage: counter [-f<fg clr>] [-b<bg clr> | -t<t idx>] [-s<style>]
               [-n] [-d<GIF dir>] [-w<#>] [-r] < -c<#> | <item> >
        -f<fg clr>   - color to render foreground in.
        -b<bg clr>   - color to render background in.
        -t<t idx>    - index to color which should be transparent.
        -s<style>    - name of number style  (#style.gif).
        -n           - no increment, just build GIF.
        -d<GIF dir>  - directory where digits are located.
                       relative to the location of this program.
        -w<#>        - width of counter in # of digits.
        -r           - raw, no HTTP prefix. not useful in HTML,
                       only on the command line.
        -h           - hidden, builds a transparent one by one GIF.

   -c<#> and <item> are exclusive.
        -c<#>        - specify the number which you want to build.
                       ignores <item> and log.
        <item>       - unique identifier for counting.
                       usually name of page.


You can get this same information by running the program at the command
line without any arguments.


Some More Advanced And Complicated Examples
-------------------------------------------

HTML Example: <img src=counter.exe?-f0000FF+-bFF0000+home.html>

This will put the graphic in your page.  The last argument I use in a log
which is created in the directory where the program resides.  This allows you
to have the count be updated.  You can also have many counts using only one
program, by just passing different names.  This will create BLUE numbers on
a RED background using the default digits.


Another HTML Example: <img src=counter.exe?-t0+-f00FF00+home.html>

This will create GREEN numbers on a TRANSPARENT background using the
default digits.


Yet Another HTML Example: <img src=counter.exe?-scb+home.html>

This creates numbers using the "cb" style.  It will look for the GIF files
in the "cntrgifs" directory, with the following names: 0cb.gif, 1cb.gif,
2cb.gif, ...


Ultimate Example: See my web page.
    http://cervantes.learningco.com/kevin/
Then view the source.

Then look at these two pages.
    http://cervantes.learningco.com/kevin/buftom/
    http://cervantes.learningco.com/kevin/amini/
View their sources as well.  You will see that I am using the same program
to count many different pages.


Separating Parameters
---------------------
On some servers, it is necessary to use a "&" instead of "+" to separate
parameters to the counter.


Specifying Colors
-----------------
When you are specifying colors you must use the following format.
RRGGBB, where each pair represents a hexadecimal number.  You must include
all necessary zeros.

Example: FF0000 - Bright Red
Example: 00FF00 - Bright Green
Example: 0000FF - Bright Blue


Specifying Digit Directory
--------------------------
The default is "cntrgifs" and is relative to the location of the program.
When specifying a different directory, remember to make it relative to
where the program resides.

Example: <img src=counter.exe?-dmydigits+-smine+home.html>

Counter will produce its GIF using the following GIF files:
mydigits/0mine.gif, mydigits/1mine.gif, mydigits/2mine.gif, ...


Counter-Counter-Terrorism
-------------------------
Create a file named "counter.cct" which resides in the same directory
as the executable.  In this text file enter the various names of the machines
on which you will have pages which use the counter.  Any page which refers to
this counter which doesn't have it's address in the "counter.cct" file will
be refused a counter and will get the "cct.gif" file in response.
Just try it.  It really works.

Many people have asked what a "counter.cct" file looks like.  Here is
an example:

---begin counter.cct---
cervantes.learningco.com
melville.learningco.com
--- end  counter.cct---

There is no longer any limit to the number of machines you can specify.


Don't Count Me
--------------
Create a file named "counter.nct" which resides in the same directory as the
executable.  In this text file enter the various IP addresses of machines which
you don't want the counter to count.  The counter will still display the
current count but it won't increment the count if the IP which is accessing
the page is present in this file.

---begin counter.nct---
192.215.244.60
192.215.244.58
192.215.244.*
--- end  counter.nct---

You may use wild cards.  This will allow you to prevent an entire domain from
being counted.  In my example above, the final entry makes the two previous
entries redundant.


Adding Your Own Digits
----------------------
You can create your own digits.  They must be GIFs and they must all be
the same height in one group.  The naming convention is the digit
followed by the style name.

Furthermore, if you do create your own digits, please write me and tell me
about them or even send them to me.  I will want to add them to my digit
page (http://cervantes.learningco.com/kevin/digits/).


Raw Output
----------
This parameter (-r) allows you to use the counter from the command line to
generate a GIF using the digits for a number.  I just added this feature to
make it easier than assembling the digits in some paint program.


Registry Entries
----------------
This section will grow in future releases.

You can specify the location of three files that the counter uses via the
registry.  Here is the list of the files and where the entry is in the
registry which controls their location and how they function in the program.
All these entries default to the same location as the "counter.exe" and using
the name specified in this list.  Each entry follows this pattern:

<default value>
    <Key and Value in Registry>
    <Explanation>

counter.log
    \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Behold! Software\Counter\Defaults\LogFile
    This is where all the counts are stored.
counter.tmp
    \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Behold! Software\Counter\Defaults\TempFile
    Where the counts are first written before being copied into "counter.log".
counter.err
    \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Behold! Software\Counter\Defaults\ErrorFile
    All error messages are written to this file.  This eases debugging.

I have included a utility and script for adding these entries to your registry.
You may wish to use a text editor to modify "reg.scr".  Simply change the
strings at the end of each line to values which are appropriate to your system.
After having done so, you should be able to run it from the command line
like this:

modreg reg.scr

You should now see the correct entries in your registry.


How do I know I can get it to work?
-----------------------------------
This counter has been proven to work on the following HTTP servers:
    -SAIC-HTTP
    -EMWAC HTTPS
    -Purveyor
    -Website
    -Netscape
    -Alibaba
    -Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)


Special Notes About Certain Servers
-----------------------------------
Website:   1. Be sure to put the counter and its support files in "cgi-shl",
              not "cgi-bin" or "cgi-win".

Netscape:  1. Be sure to enable CGI.

IIS:       1. Be sure to use the Registry Entries to set the location for
(Microsoft)   error files and temp files to be somewhere other than the default
              location (cgi-bin or scripts).

History
-------
   DATE       VERSION   COMMENT
-----------   -------   -------
27 Mar 1996   2.7.0     -Specify location of log, temp and error file in
                         registry.
                        -Temp file is now copied and then deleted, instead of
                         just being deleted.  This slightly reduces the chances
                         of losing all counts.
                        -If no log file is present and a temp file is found,
                         then the temp file is copied back to the log file.
                         This is an attempt at smooth recovery from bad crash
                         which leaves only a surviving temp file.

08 Nov 1995   2.6.0     -CCT file separated into two separate files.  One,
                         "counter.cct" serves the Counter Counter Terrorism and
                         two, "counter.nct" which is used to name machines
                         which shouldn't be counted.
                        -If wait time is exceeded on mutex then gracefully
                         exit without producing graphic, but generate error
                         to log.

02 Nov 1995   2.5.1     -Now uses Mutex instead of semaphore.  This is the
                         correct solution to multiple instances problem.

01 Nov 1995   2.5.0     -Added "-h" option which creates a one by one
                         transparent GIF, essentially hidden.

01 Nov 1995   2.4.1     -Fixed bug in command line parsing.

13 Oct 1995   2.4.0     -Added error messages for inability to delete old log
                         and rename new log to correct name.
                        -Added "-w" option to allow setting the width of the
                         output.
                        -Added "-c" option which gives you the ability to
                         build any number you like, it ignores the log.
                        -Added "-r" option which doesn't output HTTP header.
                         This allows you to redirect output to a file and
                         generate a GIF.  This is not useful within HTML.

03 Oct 1995   2.3.1     -Added a few more error messages to indicate an
                         inability to allocate memory.

28 Sep 1995   2.3.0     -Added "-d" option which allows you to set the
                         location of the digit GIFs.
                        -Replaced dumb file semaphore with real Windows
                         semaphore, which allows for queueing.
                        -Wait for semaphore clear increased from one minute
                         to two minutes.

19 Sep 1995   2.2.0     -Added "-n" option which allows you to show a count
                         without incrementing it.
                        -Digits in a set no longer have to be the same width.
                         Allows me to use all the digits on the digit page.

06 Sep 1995   2.1.0     -Implemented Counter-Counter-Terrorism.
                        -The above feature also prevents you from counting
                         hits from your own machine.

22 Aug 1995   2.0.0     -Complete re-write.
                        -Now uses GD library for GIF manipulation.
                        -Support for transparency.
                        -Uses many different digit GIFs.
                        -If digit is Black background and White foreground,
                         Then you can set the colors of the digits.
                        -Disabled buffering for stdout, decreasing chances of
                         connection reset failure.

10 Aug 1995   1.2.0     -Now has a semaphore to allow multiple instances
                         gracefully. Implemented via a file.
                        -Switches stdout to binary mode for the GIF.  Results
                         in more reliable output.
                        -Generates an error log, when there is a failure.
                         Error Log is "counter.err".  There are only 3 possible
                         errors that are detected and logged currently.

03 Aug 1995   1.1.1     -Slight bug fixes
                        -Attempted 16-bit version. (A complete failure.)

01 Aug 1995   1.0.0     -Initial release.
