    Care Center at Faith Presbyterian Hospice</font></p>
  <p><img src="tbpickens.jpg" width="1200" height="720" border="1"></p>
  <p>An architecture firm focused on senior living and health care facilities 
    has spun off of Perkins+Will.</p>
  <p>Following years of anticipation and planning, Faith Presbyterian Hospice 
    will break ground in November on the T. Boone Pickens Hospice and Palliative 
    Care Center, Dallas&#146;s first stand-alone hospice inpatient care center.</p>
  <p>A lead gift from T. Boone Pickens provided $18.4 million of the $54.6 million 
    construction cost of the new facility that will bear his name, with the remainder 
    to come from a fundraising campaign entitled A Journey to Finishing Well.</p>
  <p>&#147;Quality of life is a critical issue for me,&#148; Pickens said. &#147;I 
    believe that this groundbreaking care center will be a model for treatment 
    of those with life-limiting illnesses.&#148;</p>
  <p>Comprehensive approach to end-of-life care</p>
  <p>Designed by architecture firm PageSoutherlandPage to provide a comprehensive 
    approach to end of life care, the hospice and palliative care center will 
    consist of five Centers of Excellence:</p>
  <p> An Inpatient Care Center designed with 36 spacious inpatient care suites 
    and four family/guest suites.<br>
    A Child and Family Bereavement Center for families to explore and process 
    their grief needs at their own pace and time. Professionally staffed with 
    social workers, counselors, and music and art therapists, services in this 
    center will be provided at no charge to the participants.<br>
    An Education Training and Resource Center will partner with universities, 
    hospitals, and health care systems to provide the latest training and education 
    in hospice and palliative care. This center will also be a resource for students 
    and health care employees to execute residential rotations and internships 
    within the field.<br>
    A Spiritual Care Center with sanctuary and chapel will provide a setting for 
    solitude, prayer, and the processing of grief. This space will also be a place 
    for celebration of life events, for worship, and small memorial services. 
    Chaplains will be available to guide, accompany, plan and officiate services.<br>
    An Outdoor Reflection Center on a partially wooded nine-acre tract will be 
    surrounded by specially designed meditative and memory gardens, walking paths, 
    a labyrinth, and a tranquil spring-fed pond&#151;a place where those in all 
    stages of the journey can go to reflect, remember, and be refreshed. The ORC 
    will be open to the public and serve as a resource for the community.</p>
  <p>September 2015 opening</p>
  <p>September 2015 is the anticipated opening date for the new facility, which 
    will be located on Merit Drive near Medical City in Dallas.</p>
