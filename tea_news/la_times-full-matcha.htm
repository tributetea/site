          Matcha tiramisu from Roku</font></p>
        <p align="left">There&#146;s green tea, and then there&#146;s matcha, 
          a green tea powder made from whole ground tea leaves from Japan. (About 
          20 to 30 days before harvesting the leaves, they are shaded from direct 
          sunlight. This boosts the plant's levels of chlorophyll and gives the 
          leaves their signature, deep green hue.) Eating the ground, high-quality 
          tea leaves &#151; as opposed to steeping the leaves, like in other teas 
          &#151; yields matcha&#146;s potent, earthy flavor and high caffeine 
          content. It&#146;s more popular than ever, and we&#146;re seeing more 
          chefs and artisans incorporate matcha in certain dishes and drinks.</p>
        <p>We&#146;re also seeing an influx of restaurants and dedicated cafes 
          offering matcha service around town, including matcha Box on 3rd Street 
          and the upcoming Shuhari on Abbot Kinney Boulevard. </p>
        <p>If you&#146;re looking for matcha ice cream, Sweet Rose Creamery and 
          Coolhaus both have delicious options. And we&#146;ve got a few more 
          out-of-the-box ways to enjoy matcha.</p>
        <p><b>Macho Matcha Man -- E.P. &amp; L.P.: </b>Bartender Adam Nystrom 
          has put together a fantastic shochu sour cocktail made with matcha, 
          Asian pear, lemon and egg white that&#146;s perfect for sipping at the 
          bar or pairing with all the vibrant flavors in Louis Tikaram&#146;s 
          food. It&#146;s a tiny bit sweet and a little tangy, but the overall 
          drink is entirely smooth. 603 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, (310) 
          855-9955, www.eplosangeles.com.</p>
        <p><b>Matcha tiramisu </b>[above] <b>-- Roku:</b> Top off your teppanyaki 
          experience with alternating layers of matcha sponge cake and mousse 
          in the tiramisu at Roku on Sunset. It&#146;s finished with fresh strawberries 
          and strawberry sauce and served a la mode &#151; that&#146;s with a 
          side of green tea ice cream, of course. 9201 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, 
          (310) 278-2060, www.innovativedining.com/restaurants/roku.</p>
        <p><img src="la_times-full-matcha2.jpg" width="289" height="225"></p>
        <p><b>Matcha chicken liver mousse -- Cannibal:</b> This new Culver City 
          butchery and restaurant may be the first place you&#146;ve ever willingly 
          ordered up a green meat pat&eacute;, but they&#146;ve got a matcha chicken 
          liver mousse that is sublime. The earthy notes of the matcha do well 
          to round out the gaminess of the liver, and it&#146;s topped off with 
          roasted plums, extra virgin olive oil and granola for some fullness 
          and texture. 8850 Washington Blvd., Culver City, (310) 838-2783, www.thecanniballa.com.</p>
        <p><b>Matcha Toast -- American Tea Room:</b> This downtown tea room is 
          taking part in the current toast craze, covering a slice of brioche 
          with matcha butter, honey and Marcona almonds for a perfect snack -- 
          which you can wash down with more matcha. Try the ceremonial grade matcha 
          service or the chilled Green Tea Terer&eacute; drink, in which Bliss 
          green and white tea, lime and orange juice are combined with a sweet 
          matcha for a refreshing summer quencher. 909 S. Santa Fe Ave., Los Angeles, 
          (213) 239-9100, www.americantearoom.com/pages/los-angeles.</p>
        <p><b>Matcha budino -- Hamasaku:</b> You haven&#146;t really completed 
          your meal at Hamasaku without ordering the matcha budino. Inspired by 
          the butterscotch version across town, this budino is none too sweet 
          and even a tiny bit bitter, so you can actually taste the matcha in 
          every creamy bite. 11043 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, (310) 479-7636, 
          www.hamasakula.com.</p>
        <p><b>Sweet sandwiches -- Valerie Confections:</b> The matcha petit fours 
          at Valerie Confections have always been a favorite, but the bakery/restaurant 
          also has a limited, collaborative release of matcha sandwiches with 
          Commune. Matcha white chocolate sits between two almond and toasted 
          brown rice cookies before the cookie is dipped in darkened milk chocolate 
          and topped off with soy salt. For matcha lovers with a more formal occasion 
          in mind, Valerie has just launched a brand-new wedding catalog with 
          a matcha flavor fancy cake available. 3360 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, 
          (213) 739-8149, www.valerieconfections.com.</p>
        <p><b>Matcha doughnut -- Donut Farm:</b> The vegan, certified organic 
          doughnuts at this San Francisco import are all delicious, and their 
          matcha cake doughnut is no exception. It&#146;s got flavor both in the 
          dough, and in the glaze, for a perfectly dense, barely sweet doughnut. 
          2609 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 788-7549.</p>
        <p><b>Matcha concha -- Winsome:</b> This photogenic daytime spot (with 
          dinner coming soon) has a great house-made matcha version of the quintessential 
          Mexican pan dulce with its semi-sweet, outer shell. Made fresh every 
          day, this pastry gives off just the right hint of the powdered green 
          tea and is best enjoyed with your espresso drink of choice. 1115 Sunset 
          Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 415-1818, www.eatwinsome.com.</p>
