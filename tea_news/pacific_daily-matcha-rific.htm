        <p align="left">Satisfy that sweet tooth with a couple of new offerings 
          at the Hyatt Regency Guam.</p>
        <p>Eyeing the healthy properties of ingredients, the deli is serving up 
          a new monthly theme with its delectable desserts.</p>
        <p>Matcha-rrific</p>
        <p>Open 24 hours a day, the deli caf&eacute; offers patrons an array of 
          sandwiches, coffees and signature sweets from the Hyatt&#146;s pastry 
          kitchen.</p>
        <p>Matcha-rrific takes over the deli for the month serving up the complex 
          and bitter notes of green tea.</p>
        <p>&#147;We&#146;ve made some signature dishes from Chef Suharto Suharto 
          and Chef Brett Kim to create dishes with matcha,&#148; explains Mirko 
          Agostini, Hyatt executive chef. &#147;Green tea is matcha and it&#146;s 
          very healthy and it&#146;s very tasteful and it&#146;s unique.&#148;</p>
        <p>Some of the desserts are already staples on the Hyatt lineup, including 
          the Matcha Tiramisu from the Niji and the deli&#146;s matcha roll.</p>
        <p>Both desserts carry the Italian coffee dessert flavors complemented 
          by the delicate bitter accents of the matcha powder.</p>
        <p>For a subtle, smooth and clean take on green tea, try the creamy Matcha 
          Mousse rested atop a square of cake.</p>
        <p>Get a distinct punch of green tea with the crisp and grassy Matcha 
          Cookie, speckled with white chocolate. It&#146;s a perfect match for 
          the Matcha Latte also offered this month.</p>
        <p>And if you&#146;re in need of a decadent serving of matcha, do not 
          pass up on a slice of Matcha Cheesecake.</p>
        <p>&#147;This is to have an opportunity, to have an experience,&#148; 
          Agostini says. &#147;You come into the deli, you buy a latte, you get 
          a piece of cookie or a little slice of cake or you want to take it home, 
          you can take the whole entire cake as a gift. But we are going to be 
          more on the healthy mind each month. Each month we&#146;re going to 
          have one of the healthy ingredients and we&#146;re going to turn around 
          that to create new dishes, to incorporate healthy dishes and to see 
          what&#146;s new at the deli.&#148;</p>
        <p>The desserts range between $4 and $6 and could vary on different days.</p>
        <p>Hyatt&#146;s other new feature is heating up between 3 and 5 p.m. daily 
          in The Lounge.</p>
        <p>Your nose will guide you to the live waffle station where the Hyatt 
          staff is turning out tender in the inside, crispy on the outside, red 
          velvet waffles.</p>
        <p>For $10 plus service charge, you&#146;ll receive the velvet waffle, 
          sliced and adorned with fresh strawberries, tangy blueberries and a 
          dollop of whipped cream on the side.</p>
