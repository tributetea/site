        <p align="left">WASHINGTON, DC - Leading scientists from around the globe 
          convened yesterday in Washington, DC for the Third International Scientific 
          Symposium on Tea &amp; Human Health: Role of Flavonoids in the Diet 
          to review the latest findings on the potential health benefits of tea, 
          including new studies on promoting heart health and reducing the risk 
          for cancer. The latest data provide further evidence of tea's potential 
          disease-fighting capabilities. Major research developments since the 
          Second Symposium on Tea &amp; Human Health, held in 1998, include new 
          results that suggest:</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font size="+1">&middot;</font> Tea may reduce Low 
          Density Lipoprotein (LDL, or &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol) levels by 
          10 percent<br>
          <font size="+1">&middot;</font> Consumption of as little as four cups 
          of tea per day may contribute to cardiovascular health by improving 
          endothelial function, as seen in clinical studies<br>
          <font size="+1">&middot;</font> Tea may reduce oxidative stress, as 
          indicated by decreases in DNA damage in smokers<br>
          <font size="+1">&middot;</font> Tea consumption is linked with a 60 
          percent decrease in rectal cancer among women</b></p>
        <p align="left">The symposium, which was sponsored by the American Cancer 
          Society, the American College of Nutrition, the American Health Foundation, 
          the American Society for Nutritional Sciences, the Food and Agriculture 
          Organization, the Linus Pauling Institute and the Tea Council of the 
          U.S.A., was held at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
          Leading researchers from around the world joined American scientists 
          in presenting the latest clinical, laboratory and epidemiological data 
          on the role of tea in promoting healthfulness and reducing the risk 
          of disease.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;As investigators continue to study the multiple 
          effects that tea has on human health, more research supports tea's potential 
          in helping to reduce the incidence of major diseases,&quot; said the 
          meeting's co-chair, Jeffrey Blumberg, PhD, Professor, Friedman School 
          of Nutrition Science and Policy, and Chief, Antioxidants Research Laboratory, 
          Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, 
          Boston. &quot;The scientific community is making tremendous strides 
          in discovering the potential for flavonoids in black and green tea and 
          other plant foods to promote health and reduce the risk of certain chronic 
          diseases, findings which could have significant implications for public 
          health.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left"><i><b>Studies Suggest Tea Consumption May Lower &quot;Bad&quot; 
          Cholesterol</b></i><br>
          The results of a new clinical study suggest that tea consumption may 
          decrease LDL cholesterol by 10 percent when combined with a &quot;Step 
          I&quot; type diet, moderately low in fat and cholesterol, as described 
          by the American Heart Association and the National Cholesterol Education 
          Program. The study, conducted at the USDA Beltsville Human Nutrition 
          Research Center in Beltsville, MD, is the first investigation of tea 
          in which the subjects' diets were precisely controlled by having them 
          eat meals prepared at the research facility. In addition to the &quot;Step 
          I&quot; diet, all subjects consumed five cups of either caffeinated 
          tea, a placebo beverage with color and flavor closely matching that 
          of the tea, but having no caffeine, or a similar placebo beverage with 
          caffeine added to the same concentration as in the tea. &quot;This clinical 
          trial is one of the first to show significant benefits of tea on blood 
          cholesterol,&quot; said Joseph Judd, PhD, Acting Director, Beltsville 
          Human Nutrition Research Center, and the study's lead researcher. &quot;The 
          controlled diet allowed us to closely examine the effects of tea drinking 
          in conjunction with a healthy diet on cholesterol levels free from the 
          interference by variation in other nutrients or components of the diet.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">These new developments in tea research add to the growing 
          body of evidence suggesting that tea consumption positively impacts 
          cardiovascular health in several different ways, with as little as two 
          to four cups per day. Another study, published in the May 6, 2002 issue 
          of Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association, found that 
          study participants who drank four cups of tea per day had a significantly 
          lower risk of death following a heart attack. Additional research suggests 
          that tea flavonoids may support endothelial function, an important indicator 
          of cardiovascular health. More research is necessary to conclude that 
          tea may be used as a preventive measure to combat the risk of heart 
          disease, but the results so far are extremely promising.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>New Developments in Cancer Research Lung Cancer</i></b><br>
          In the first intervention study using tea, preliminary findings suggest 
          that smokers who drank tea had significantly lower levels of oxidative 
          DNA damage. Oxidative stress to DNA is implicated in a multitude of 
          chronic diseases, including cancer. In this clinical study, smokers 
          drank four cups of decaffeinated green tea, decaffeinated black tea 
          or water for four months. Researchers then looked at several biomarkers 
          of oxidative stress, or DNA damage. Preliminary results found that smokers 
          who drank green tea showed a significant decrease in urinary biomarkers 
          of oxidative DNA damage. </p>
        <p align="left">Researchers have also observed similar results in animal 
          studies, in which tea inhibited tobacco-induced lung tumor formation. 
          &quot;We know that smokers' bodies sustain a high level oxidative damage 
          and are at risk for certain cancers,&quot; said Iman Hakim, MD, PhD, 
          MPH, Division Director, Health Promotional Sciences, Arizona Cancer 
          Center and Research Associate Professor of Public Health, College of 
          Public Health, University of Arizona. &quot;Because this population 
          has elevated levels of oxidative damage at baseline, we are better able 
          to observe the effects that tea consumption has on oxidative stress.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Rectal Cancer</i></b><br>
          According to an epidemiological study conducted in Russia to determine 
          the protective nature of black tea against rectal cancer, women who 
          consume high levels of tea were shown to have a 60 percent reduction 
          in the risk of rectal cancer, as compared to women who drank relatively 
          low amounts of tea. Researchers identified patients recently diagnosed 
          with rectal cancer and questioned them about their tea-drinking habits, 
          then divided the participants into three groups based on the amount 
          of dry tea used per month: low consumption, less than 80g dry tea per 
          month; moderate consumption, 80 - 160g dry tea per month; and high consumption, 
          more than 160g dry tea per month. The Russian population was selected, 
          not only because tea drinking is an essential part of the culture, but 
          also because of the traditional method in which tea is prepared. As 
          is the custom, black tea is brewed at a high concentration, then consumed 
          in a diluted form throughout the day. Instead of measuring tea consumption 
          in terms of fluid measures, intake was measured by the amount of dry 
          tea used to make the tea concentrate. In addition to the 60 percent 
          reduction in risk of rectal cancer found in heavy tea-drinking women, 
          researchers found that women who were moderate tea-drinkers had a 52 
          percent reduction in the risk of rectal cancer as compared to women 
          in the low consumption group. Although men were also recruited for the 
          study, the findings were much weaker, possibly due to the men's high 
          volume of alcohol intake.</p>
        <p align="left">These new findings are an important step in determining 
          the potential role of tea components in cancer prevention and complements 
          previous studies that have found tea drinking to be associated with 
          a decreased risk of certain cancers. More research is necessary before 
          a definitive link can be made, but the current research looks promising. 
        </p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Mechanism of Action and Bioavailability of Tea Flavonoids 
          </i></b><br>
          While the established body of tea research strongly suggests that tea 
          consumption offers a wide variety of health benefits, ranging from the 
          promotion of heart health and reduced risk of some forms of cancer, 
          the actual mechanisms by which the benefits are wrought remains under 
          investigation. In vitro studies suggest that tea flavonoids protect 
          against oxidation, but there may be other mechanisms by which tea components 
          function once they are absorbed into the body.</p>
        <p align="left">During digestion, flavonoid molecules undergo biochemical 
          changes. Since these compounds are modified in the gut, flavonoids may 
          still protect against oxidative stress, but may function by other mechanisms 
          as well in vivo. In vivo studies suggest that flavonoids interrupt the 
          pathway of oxidative stress and intercept the &quot;message&quot; for 
          apoptosis, or cell death.</p>
        <p align="left">Black tea's flavonoids are complex in structure and appear 
          to be absorbed at different points in the body. Some of the larger molecules 
          are not absorbed in the stomach or small intestines, but remain intact 
          until they reach the colon, where they are partly absorbed into the 
          bloodstream. The remaining flavonoids may act as antioxidants and reduce 
          the risk of colon cancer. Because black tea's flavonoids remain intact 
          through much of the gastrointestinal tract, it seems that the flavonoids 
          may have potential benefits at various points throughout the gut. Conversely, 
          the principle constituents of green tea, are simple flavonoids, called 
          catechins, which are quickly absorbed into the body after consumption. 
          &quot;Because green and black tea flavonoids appear to be absorbed and 
          metabolized at different points throughout the digestion process, flavonoids 
          may have an even wider range of protective benefits to various body 
          systems than originally thought,&quot; explained Dr. Blumberg.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Looking Toward the Future</i></b><br>
          The ongoing scientific exploration of the health benefits of drinking 
          tea has led to a growing body of research that points to tea as being 
          an important contributor to overall health. Research continues to show 
          that flavonoids seem to have a potent effect in maintaining the health 
          and function of cells and physiological systems - and tea is a major 
          source of flavonoids in the human diet.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;The research presented at this year's symposium 
          further extends the scientific evidence that tea may have a favorable 
          effect on the cardiovascular system and may positively impact health 
          in many other ways, including reducing the risk for some cancers,&quot; 
          said Dr. Blumberg. </p>
        <p align="left">Looking towards the future, researchers plan to probe 
          deeper into the various mechanisms by which tea flavonoids function 
          in the body and the implications these mechanisms have on human health 
          and disease prevention. Clinical trials now underway and being planned 
          will provide further important information about the role of tea in 
          health promotion.</p>
