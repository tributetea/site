        <p align="left">Matcha isn't just for Japanese teahouses anymore. The 
          antioxidant-rich green tea, which is really a powder made from steamed 
          and dried tea leaves, has been around for thousands of years. It's traditionally 
          whisked in hot water and has an earthy flavor and a bright green color 
          that's almost unnatural. But it is natural, and good for you, too, even 
          if it's made into a donut glaze. From ceremonial tableside service in 
          Brentwood steakhouses to creative cocktails in West Hollywood, the frothy, 
          ultra-green green tea is popping up just about everywhere this summer. 
          Here are some of the most unique uses around town right now.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Baltaire: </b>It's not that a matcha tea service is 
          particularly unusual, it's just that this swank Brentwood steakhouse 
          puts its own twist on it. A self-described matcha obsessive, beverage 
          director David Vaughn collaborated with Art of Tea&#146;s master tea 
          blender, Steve Schwartz, to create a special blend for this traditional 
          tableside tea service. After dinner, a server wheels a cart over to 
          carefully whisk and blend the green tea powder for each guest. It's 
          relaxing to watch, and there's a good chance the tea's healthy attributes 
          will balance out that bone-in rib-eye and lobster mac 'n' cheese you 
          just ate.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Cafe Gratitude:</b> Many tea drinkers are figuring 
          out that matcha can be served cold. At the three local outposts of this 
          vegan-happy spot, including the Venice, Larchmont and new Arts District 
          locations, order the Vibrant &#151; a soothing, earthy cold brew of 
          green tea, almond milk and honey.</p>
        <p align="left"><b>Gracias Madre: </b>Not only can matcha be served cold, 
          but it can also be used in cocktails, as beverage man Jason Eisner found 
          out. Eisner's matcha cocktail is a blend of tequila, matcha, coconut 
          milk, toasted sesame-infused agave and tapioca pearls, which goes nicely 
          with the vegan tacos, enchiladas and queso at the West Hollywood restaurant. 
          Rustic Canyon: Pastry chef Jun Tan is consistently inspired by his childhood 
          when crafting whimsical, farmers&#146; market-inspired desserts for 
          the bustling Santa Monica restaurant. Right now, he's using sister shop 
          Sweet Rose Creamery's seasonal ice creams and sorbets in his creations, 
          like the green tea donut ice cream sandwich with Valrhona chocolate 
          sauce.</p>
        <p align="left"><img src="zag_petit.jpg" width="289" height="240"></p>
        <p align="left"><b>Valerie:</b> The confectioner's pretty petit fours 
          are the perfect bite-size cake treats. The matcha petit four layers 
          green tea cake with lemon verbena ganache and a white chocolate coating. 
          The light green tinge makes it stand out from the others, although it's 
          a perfect match for the rose-petal topped petit fours. Find it at all 
          three Valerie locations &#151; in the Grand Central Market, in Echo 
          Park and at the original Los Feliz bakery.</p>
        <p><b>Republique:</b> Does matcha lose its health benefits if it's turned 
          into a glaze for Margarita Manzke's raised donuts? Who cares. The La 
          Brea hot spot started serving these donuts as a special, and we really 
          hope they make the regular rotation in the pastry case soon.</p>
        <p><b>Scoops:</b> Pop into the Westside or East Hollywood ice cream shop 
          and there's a good chance the rotating menu will have something like 
          the green tea and brown rice non-dairy treat on hand. Flavors change 
          regularly, so call ahead if it's something you really want (or to find 
          out when it will be made again).</p>
