        <p> <font size="3">If you&#146;re active on Instagram or Pinterest, chances 
          are you&#146;ve seen countless images of beautiful cups of matcha green 
          tea, lattes, smoothies and more. Common in Asia for centuries, matcha 
          made its way to the United States many years ago, but has taken off 
          in the last few years. As with any trend, you may wonder if matcha is 
          good for you, or if it&#146;s all hype. In this case, there&#146;s compelling 
          research to support this beautiful green elixir.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">What is Matcha?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Matcha is a green tea powder that&#146;s 
          full of healthy compounds. Though now also produced in China, matcha 
          was originally only grown and harvested in the southern region of Japan. 
          It's traditionally prepared and poured in the Japanese tea ceremony, 
          a ritual that focuses on intention and mindfulness.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">If you like the taste of green tea, you&#146;ll 
          love matcha. Though some might say it&#146;s an acquired taste, matcha 
          tends to be less bitter than standard green tea. It&#146;s rich and 
          smooth, and the flavor is a little grassy &#150; in a good way. Because 
          it&#146;s a powder, matcha can be dissolved in warm water to enjoy as 
          a healthy beverage or prepared in a variety of other ways.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Why Drink Matcha?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">It&#146;s potent. Unlike the tea you steep 
          and sip, with matcha you consume the entire tea leaf. Because nothing 
          is left behind, matcha delivers a more concentrated cup of nutrients 
          and antioxidants than steeped teas. For example, research shows that 
          matcha contains at least three times the epigallocatechin gallate as 
          steeped green tea. EGCG is the polyphenol known for its ability to slightly 
          boost calorie burn and studied for its role in reducing cancer cell 
          growth.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Here are a few of the health benefits common 
          to green tea and multiplied in matcha:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">It provides small amounts of vitamins and 
          minerals.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Matcha is rich in polyphenols (antioxidants) 
          that may help fight certain cancers, reduce the risk of heart disease 
          and even offer some anti-aging benefits.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">It may help you focus. Matcha is rich in 
          the amino acid L-theanine, which is known for its relaxing and anti-anxiety 
          effects. In conjunction with the caffeine naturally present in matcha, 
          theanine may help increase alertness without the jittery feeling some 
          people get from coffee and other caffeinated products.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Matcha inspires mindfulness. Unlike standard 
          steeped tea, matcha requires a few extra preparation steps &#150; making 
          it a perfect way to slow down and be more mindful about the process 
          and the day ahead.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">The benefits are solid. If you&#146;re 
          ready to jump on the matcha bandwagon, you should know that pure matcha 
          will cost a little more than a typical box of green tea from the supermarket. 
          A small tin &#150; which makes 20 to 25 cups &#150; can cost upwards 
          of $25. But put in perspective, at roughly $1 per cup, it&#146;s less 
          expensive than a morning latte or frappucino at your local coffee shop.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Like anything, a cup of matcha is only 
          as good as its source. Matcha is powdered green tea, but not all powdered 
          green tea is matcha. There are imposters. Do some research and take 
          these steps to ensure you get the best quality for your money:</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Buy from a reputable source.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Check the color. Good quality matcha will 
          have a vibrant green color. The delicate powder will be light and brightly 
          colored.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Skip the matcha mixes and blends. Many 
          of these include other ingredients like sugar and may not use the highest 
          quality tea.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">Once you find your favorite, store matcha 
          in the original packaging &#150; usually a small tin &#150; in a dark, 
          cool location. Some tea experts recommend keeping it in the freezer 
          to maintain freshness. In any case, seal it tight after each use to 
          keep moisture out.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="3">I suggest enjoying your first sip simply 
          whisked with warm water - no added sugar &#150; to get a feel for it. 
          Matcha is good all on its own. If you&#146;re not quite ready to swap 
          your morning cup of joe for matcha, enjoy it in other ways. Add other 
          flavors and try different recipes. These are not traditional ways to 
          use matcha, but they&#146;re tasty nonetheless:</font></p>

          to add depth and flavor to a variety of recipes. Add a teaspoon to your 
          morning smoothie, yogurt or oats, create a savory marinade or sauce 
          for fish, chicken gif or tofu, or add it to cool, creamy desserts. The 
          options are only limited by your imagination.</font></p>
