          <b><font color="#990000">CAFFEINE MAY LOWER SKIN CANCER RISK</font></b></p>
        <p align="left">Caffeine, the chemical stimulant in coffee and tea, has 
          been found to lower the risk of skin cancer in laboratory mice. A study 
          suggests that a skin lotion spiked with caffeine or with another compound 
          found in green tea can reduce by more than half the number of cancer 
          tumors on the skin of hairless mice exposed to brutal levels of ultraviolet 
          radiation.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;WE HAD between 50 to 70 percent tumor formation 
          inhibition in the mice that were treated with caffeine or with EGCG 
          (the other chemical compound),&quot; said Dr. Allan Conney, senior author 
          of a study appearing this week in the online site of the Proceedings 
          of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>
        <p align="left">Skin cancer is the most common of all cancers in the United 
          States. The American Academy of Dermatology estimates about a million 
          cases will be diagnosed in the country this year. Among them will be 
          more than 88,000 new cases of melanoma, the disease's deadliest form. 
          Skin cancer generally is curable by cutting, burning or freezing the 
          tumor cells, but untreated it can be deadly.</p>
        <p align="left">To test effects of caffeine on skin cancer, Conney, a 
          professor of cancer and leukemia research at Rutgers University in New 
          Brunswick, N.J., and his colleagues exposed 90 mice to high levels of 
          ultraviolet radiation twice a day for 20 days. They used a strain of 
          animals, called hairless mice, commonly used for skin cancer studies.</p>
        <p align="left">After the mice got their UVB doses, the animals were divided 
          into three groups. One group were slathered daily with a solution of 
          acetone and caffeine. Another group received acetone and EGCG. The third 
          group got skin applications of acetone only. Acetone is an organic solution 
          often used on the skin.</p>
        <p align="left">At the end of 18 weeks, the three groups of mice were 
          killed, and the level of skin tumor formation was analyzed.</p>
        <p align="left">Conney said mice in all three groups developed malignant 
          skin tumors, called squamous cell carcinomas, but the number of tumors 
          per mouse was reduced by 72 percent in those treated with caffeine and 
          by 66 percent among those treated with EGCG, compared to the controls 
          treated only with acetone.</p>
        <p align="left">The treated mice also had fewer nonmalignant, sunlight-related 
          tumors, said Conney. Compared to the control group of mice, the mice 
          treated with caffeine had 44 percent fewer nonmalignant tumors, the 
          EGCG group 55 percent fewer, he said.</p>
        <p align="left">Conney said that although both compounds were effective 
          in lower tumor risk, caffeine has an advantage because it is chemically 
          more stable than EGCG.</p>
        <p align="left">Unlike sunscreen lotions, which protect against skin cancer 
          by preventing the skin from absorbing ultraviolet rays from the sun, 
          the caffeine's cancer protection works in the cells after exposure to 
          the ultraviolet rays. Rays from the sun can cause genetic changes in 
          the skin that can lead to skin cancer.</p>
        <p align="left">Conney said caffeine apparently blocks this action by 
          causing abnormal cells to kill themselves, a type of programmed cell 
          suicide that prevents development of abnormal growths. &quot;This is 
          not a sunscreening effect,&quot; said Conney. &quot;It is a biological 
          effect.&quot; He said the caffeine acts selectively, causing the abnormal 
          cells to die but not affecting the normal cells.</p>
        <p align="left">Dr. Darrell Rigel, a professor of dermatology at New York 
          University and an expert spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology, 
          said research like Conney's is needed badly because &quot;skin cancer 
          is a major problem. I hope this treatment can prove itself, because 
          there are more skin cancers than all other cancers combined in the U.S.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">He said there is a need for a &quot;morning-after&quot; 
          treatment for skin cancer, a therapy that would reduce cancer risk after 
          excessive sun exposure.</p>
        <p align="left">Rigel said that although hairless mice are commonly used 
          for such research, &quot;there is really no good animal model for skin 
          cancer. The hairless mouse is the best of a bunch of bad choices&quot; 
          for testing skin cancer compounds in the laboratory. As a result, he 
          said, &quot;a lot of things that work in mice cannot be extrapolated 
          to humans.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">He said other treatments that showed promise in mice have 
          often failed when tried on humans. Conney said the next step in studying 
          the topical effects of caffeine will be to use the solution on people 
          who are highly susceptible to skin cancer - people who have a precancerous 
          condition or who already have had skin.</p>
