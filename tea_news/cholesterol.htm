          Effect of a Theaflavin-Enriched Green Tea Extract</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#666666">OVERVIEW</font></b> - [Dr. David] 
          Maron and colleagues studied the impact of a theaflavin-enriched green 
          tea extract on the lipid and lipoprotein levels of subjects with mild 
          to moderate hypercholesterolemia in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 
          parallel-group trial in China. A total of 240 men and women 18 years 
          or older on a low-fat diet with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia 
          were randomly assigned to receive a daily capsule containing theaflavin-enriched 
          green tea extract (375 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures 
          were mean percentage changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
          cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride 
          levels compared with baseline.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#666666">BACKGROUND</font></b> - Tea consumption 
          has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk, but potential 
          mechanisms of benefit are ill-defined. While epidemiologic studies suggest 
          that drinking multiple cups of tea per day lowers low-density lipoprotein 
          [i.e. &quot;bad&quot;] cholesterol (LDL-C), previous trials of tea drinking 
          and administration of green tea extract have failed to show any impact 
          on lipids and lipoproteins in humans. Our objective was to study the 
          impact of a theaflavin-enriched green tea extract on the lipids and 
          lipoproteins of subjects with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><font color="#666666">METHODS</font></b> - Double-blind, 
          randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial set in outpatient 
          clinics in 6 urban hospitals in China. A total of 240 men and women 
          18 years or older on a low-fat diet with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia 
          were randomly assigned to receive a daily capsule containing theaflavin-enriched 
          green tea extract (375 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. Main outcome measures 
          were mean percentage changes in total cholesterol, LDL-C, high-density 
          lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride levels compared with 
          baseline.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#666666"><b>RESULTS</b></font> - After 12 
          weeks, the mean &plusmn; SEM changes from baseline in total cholesterol, 
          LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglyceride levels were -11.3% &plusmn; 0.9% (P = 
          .01), -16.4% &plusmn; 1.1% (P = .01), 2.3% &plusmn; 2.1% (P = .27), 
          and 2.6% &plusmn; 3.5% (P = .47), respectively, in the tea extract group. 
          The mean levels of total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides 
          did not change significantly in the placebo group. No significant adverse 
          events were observed.</p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#666666"><b>CONCLUSION</b></font> - The theaflavin-enriched 
          green tea extract we studied is an effective adjunct to a low-saturated-fat 
          diet to reduce LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic adults and is well tolerated.</p>
