        <p align="left">Let&#146;s be honest &#151; it&#146;s pretty hard to get 
          through the day without a little caffeine boost. But too much coffee 
          could leave you feeling shaky and anxious, and chemical-laden energy 
          drinks should be forever banished to a fraternity house basement. </p>
        <p>Enter matcha: a traditional Japanese powdered green tea that&#146;s 
          harvested from the tips of the plant while they&#146;re still young 
          and packed with flavor, nutrients and caffeine &#151; but not the kind 
          that makes you crash, fans of the drink say. </p>
        <p>A two-gram serving of matcha contains just as much caffeine as an espresso, 
          but the way it makes you feel can be very different from that of your 
          afternoon latte. Proponents of matcha say that its caffeine releases 
          more slowly throughout the day, preventing the quick burn and crash 
          they experience from other sources of caffeine. Meaning, you stay on 
          your grind (or &#147;hustle,&#148; as Graham Fortgang, co-owner of New 
          York City&#146;s MatchaBar likes to call it) for even longer. </p>
        <p>Fans also say that not only does matcha keep you energized, but it 
          also makes you feel more relaxed and less anxious than a shot of espresso 
          or an energy drink. Matcha contains L-Theanine, a natural calming agent 
          that works with the caffeine to provide what&#146;s described as a calm, 
          focused and happy energy.</p>
        <p>It&#146;s also said to have 10 times the antioxidants of a cup of regular 
          green tea, which helps control blood sugar and cholesterol levels and 
          can even boost your metabolism. </p>
        <p>Can&#146;t argue with that.</p>
