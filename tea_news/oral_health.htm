        <p align="left">A spot of tea may offer more than just a pleasant way 
          to pass the afternoon. Research findings presented this week at the 
          103rd General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology in Washington, 
          D.C. suggests that it can help fight bad breath and may boost the powers 
          of toothpaste. <br>
          <br>
          Christine Wu and Min Zhu of the University of Illinois at Chicago College 
          of Dentistry isolated chemical components of tea leaves known as polyphenols 
          and tested them against three species of bacteria known to cause bad 
          breath. The researchers found that the compounds, specifically catechins 
          and theaflavins, inhibited growth of the oral bacteria over a 48-hour 
          incubation period. What is more, lower concentrations of the chemicals 
          interfered with the enzyme that catalyzes the production of hydrogen 
          sulfide, which has the notorious smell of rotten eggs, and reduced its 
          production by 30 percent. The compounds studied by the scientists are 
          present in both green tea and black tea, although they are more abundant 
          in the latter.<br>
          <br>
          In a second study, researchers reported that green tea may provide additional 
          benefits. Milton Schiffenbauer of Pace University and his colleagues 
          tested tea's ability to fight bacteria that cause infections such as 
          strep throat and dental caries. They found that green tea extracts and 
          polyphenols--particularly those from caffeinated beverages--inhibited 
          bacterial growth. Adding these agents to toothpaste and mouthwash, he 
          notes, may make them more effective at combating microbial agents. <br>
