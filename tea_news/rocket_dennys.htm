        <p>Denny's customers can enjoy the taste of Kyoto's Uji matcha green tea 
          this summer.</p>
        <p>For a popular family restaurant chain that markets itself as &quot;America&#146;s 
          Diner&quot;, Denny's still knows how to please local tastes in Japan. 
          From Pok&eacute;mon-themed pancakes to traditional rice and noodle dishes, 
          there's always something special on the menu to keep customers coming 
          back for more, and this summer, they&#146;re enticing us by adding a 
          touch of Kyoto to their dessert menu, with a number of new sweets containing 
          highly regarded matcha powdered green tea from Uji. With pancakes and 
          tiramisu on offer, deep shades of green have never looked so tantalising.</p>
        <p>The <b>Uji Tiramisu-Style Matcha</b> (530 yen) comes served in a beautiful 
          Japanese bowl, with contrasting colours of green and white made up of 
          deep-coloured bitter green tea jelly and supple, rich mascarpone cream. 
          The silky textures are topped off with a crunchy green tea crumb and 
          chewy shiratama glutinous rice balls.</p>
        <p>The <b>Uji Matcha Sundae</b> (753 yen) packs an impressive serving 
          of traditional Japanese flavours into a tall glass, creating a visually 
          striking dessert. The bittersweet flavour and refreshing fragrance of 
          green tea jelly and ice cream is joined by the subtle, earthy tones 
          of sweet adzuki red beans, and topped off with whipped cream, matcha 
          crumbs and shiratama rice balls.</p>
        <p>The <b>Uji Matcha Mini Parfait</b> (498 yen) condenses the flavours 
          from the taller sundae into a more compact dessert. The upper layer 
          of brown hojicha roasted green tea crumble, however, has been replaced 
          with a handful of crunchy cornflakes.</p>
        <p>The <b>Uji Matcha Pancakes</b> (579 yen) are topped with a dollop of 
          smooth, thick green-tea-flavoured cream, alongside scoops of mascarpone 
          and matcha ice cream and a crunchy hojicha crumble. Cutting into the 
          three-tiered pancake reveals a moist centre of strawberry jam, mascarpone 
          and boiled sweet red beans, which provide a variety of flavours in every 
          mouthful.</p>
        <p>The delicious new matcha dessert menu will be available at Denny's 
          restaurants around the country from 7 June.</p>
