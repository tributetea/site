        <p align="left">Study results reported in the Proceedings of the National 
          Academy of Sciences indicate that antioxidants found in green tea, known 
          as polyphenols, may effectively reduce the incidence and severity of 
          rheumatoid arthritis. </p>
        <p align="left">The lead author of the study was Dr. Tariq Haqqi of Case 
          Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. Haqqi and his team of 
          researchers used mice to study the effect of polyphenols in rheumatoid 
          arthritis, a disease characterized by inflammation, pain, swelling, 
          and joint destruction.</p>
        <p align="left">The mice in the study were given either plain water or 
          water enriched with green tea. The dosages given were comparable to 
          human consumption of four cups of green tea per day. The mice were then 
          injected with collagen for the purpose of inducing arthritis. Collagen-induced 
          arthritis is considered very similar to human rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
        <p align="left">The study results concluded that mice which were fed the 
          green tea polyphenols were significantly less susceptible to developing 
          collagen-induced arthritis than the mice not fed green tea polyphenols. 
          For the mice fed green tea which did however develop arthritis it occurred 
          as late onset and mild. Only 8 out of 18 mice receiving green tea polyphenols 
          developed arthritis, while 17 out of 18 mice not receiving green tea 
          polyphenols developed arthritis.</p>
        <p align="left">Examination of joint tissue microscopically revealed marginal 
          infiltration of joint cells in mice receiving the green tea in contrast 
          with massive infiltration in the mice not fed green tea.</p>
        <p align="left">It is also interesting to note that in some countries 
          such as India, China, and Japan green tea is regarded as healthful with 
          the potential to prevent certain illnesses. Seemingly, rheumatoid arthritis 
          in these countries exists at a much lower rate than elsewhere around 
          the world.</p>
