          Matcha is making its mark on menus.<br>

        <p align="left">From ramen to grilled cheese, the micro-focus of restaurants 
          in North America has been increasing, serving up the concept of a single 
          item as a specialty. These single-serve restaurants are common in other 
          countries around the world, from hawker stalls to taquerias, but the 
          idea has been somewhat lost in the crowd of one-stop-shop mega menus 
          that dominated chain concepts of yore.</p>
        <p align="left">Ingredient-driven menus based on trend items have a new 
          entry point with the consumer fascination with tea &#151; green tea 
          in particular. In Canada, Toronto may be hitting peak matcha saturation 
          with a new cafe serving only green-tinged delights. Japanese tea company 
          Tsujiri offers up o-matcha cappuccinos, cakes, sundaes and floats based 
          on the 155 year old brand&#146;s menu in Japan, China, Taiwan and Singapore. 
          According to the website, Tsuji continues in the tradition of the brand 
          founded in 1860 in Kyoto by Riemon Tsuji.</p>
        <p>The new cafe isn&#146;t the only eatery seeing green in across the 
          country &#151; it joins several stalwarts including an offshoot of Toronto 
          favorite Uncle Tetsu&#146;s Cheesecake: Uncle Tetsu&#146;s Matcha Cafe, 
          which opened in June 2015, serving matcha madeleines, soft serve and, 
          naturally, cheesecake. In Vancouver, Basho Cafe has been serving up 
          matcha flavored baked goods since 2014, such as cupcakes, cookies and 
          white chocolate brownies.</p>
        <p>Beyond the restaurant world, matcha maniacs tend to get a little obsessed: 
          from tea tools being named as an interior design trend to matcha usurping 
          kale from health and wellness trend lists for 2016. People who may think 
          regular cookies are pass&eacute; can now enjoy matcha Oreos, which can 
          be crushed into a McDonald&#146;s Matcha McFlurry.</p>
        <p>For purists, however, the last straw may be the introduction of &#147;vin 
          au th&eacute; vert&#148;, or matcha wine. The collaboration between 
          Tamba Wine and the Itohkyuemon tea store in Japan combines green tea 
          powder with a white wine base. The matcha green tea white wine is part 
          of the company&#146;s &#147;Yokan no Midori&#148; (Midnight Green) line, 
          with a green tea liquor and Matcha Junmaishu with a sake base. Matcha 
          lovers may want to start drowning their sorrows now.</p>
