        <p align="left">It&#146;s no secret we at <i>Bon App&eacute;tit</i> love 
          the powdered green tea known as matcha. Heck, we even put it in our 
          holiday cookies. But we&#146;re not the only ones smitten by matcha. 
          With one finger on the mug of our green tea latte and the other on the 
          pulse of all things up-and-coming in the food world, we can&#146;t help 
          but notice that the chatter about matcha is getting louder. Food-forward 
          Instagrammers are increasingly as likely to snap a picture of a matcha 
          latte (using the hashtag #matcha, of course) as they are a cappuccino, 
          and they can now do so at specialty matcha caf&eacute;s cropping up 
          across the country, from New York to California to Hanoi.</p>
        <p>Matcha drinkers are purchasing whisks and glass bowls to prepare the 
          beverage at home. They&#146;re sipping for a sustained energy boost, 
          loads of antioxidants, a &#147;calm-alertness&#148; thanks to an amino 
          acid called L-Theanine, increased metabolism, and a caffeine hit without 
          the jittery after-effect. All this means that there&#146;s a matcha 
          movement happening, and it&#146;s about to reach a fever pitch.</p>
        <p>What makes this green machine so special? Vibrant in hue, matcha is 
          a finely ground powder made from green tea leaves. Traditional matcha 
          growers gradually shade the plants before hand-picking the leaves and 
          stone-grinding them into a verdant dust. This process preserves both 
          the color and nutritional qualities of the tea. It&#146;s ritualistically 
          prepared in single batches by adding hot but not boiling water and whisking 
          vigorously in an &#147;M&#148; shape to dissolve the powder and froth 
          the top. The finished matcha is then drunk in a few sips directly from 
          the glass bowl in which it was prepared. The powder gradually settles 
          to the bottom of the bowl or cup, so it should be drunk quickly.</p>
        <p>This means that matcha drinkers must prepare the tea immediately before 
          consuming. Giant-sized cup of coffee to be slurped throughout the day, 
          this is not. And that, according to its devotees, is exactly what makes 
          it so attractive.</p>
        <p><b>A Homemade Ritual: DIY Matcha</b><br>
          Because matcha isn&#146;t yet as pervasive in our culinary landscape 
          as, say, the flat white, many enthusiasts who want to drink it must 
          make it at home. And that&#146;s just fine with them: It&#146;s the 
          process of whisking up a cup that initially draws people in. To Jessica 
          Lloyd, co-owner of matcha distributor Panatea, drinking the tea is about 
          more than sipping a toasty beverage with a caffeine jolt. &#147;I actually 
          look forward to the ritual of making it every morning,&#148; she explains. 
          &#147;The act of whisking it forces you to be present and collect yourself&#151;if 
          only for a few sips.&#148;</p>
        <p>A well-made &#147;shot&#148; of matcha has a creamy mouthfeel that 
          is reminiscent of an espresso with a nice amount of crema. The term 
          &#147;shot&#148; is marginally misleading&#151;although it&#146;s only 
          about 2-3 ounces of liquid, a matcha shot is sipped, not tossed back. 
          To achieve this level of matcha-nirvana, you&#146;ll need the right 
          equipment and good-quality tea. Although there are many different grades 
          available, most drinkers agree that the daily matcha gets made with 
          decent-but-not-obscenely-expensive tea. (High-end matcha can retail 
          for as much as $165/20 grams, as sold by Samovar tea). Not sure what 
          price point is right for you? Christine Muhlke, BA&#145;s executive 
          editor says: &#147;I recommend to those starting out to buy in the $14-$18 
          range. The $8 stuff is for baking. The $30-$60 stuff comes later.&#148; 
          And if you&#146;re still balking at the price, consider the fact that 
          one of those tiny tins lasts Muhlke six months or more. She orders in 
          20-gram tins from Panatea and Ippodo, and stores them in the fridge 
          to keep them fresh.</p>
        <p>A freshly-whisked cup of matcha is attractive in its simplicity. But 
          that doesn&#146;t mean this green tea can&#146;t play nice with other 
          flavors. In fact, many home-whiskers (it&#146;s not brewing, per se) 
          have a unique take on the drink. Muhlke says that her favorite way to 
          take a cup of matcha to the next level is to swap hot water for homemade 
          almond milk. She explains: &#147;Almond milk has its own natural sweetness, 
          with a gently rounded flavor that complements matcha&#146;s angular 
          grassiness. Milk is too fatty in its mouthfeel and overpowering/cloying 
          for some reason&#151;it cancels out the matcha. Soy is fine, but almond 
          also manages to create a nice crema&#151;perfect for lattes.&#148;</p>
        <p>The technique is pretty simple: Just add liquid and whisk until frothy. 
          But in case you&#146;re looking for a little guided instruction, the 
          matcha community is eager to share its knowledge. Panatea&#146;s website 
          features a how-to video, and we even published a pictorial step-by-step 
          on bonappetit.com last year. The San-Francisco-based Breakaway Matcha 
          aims to educate converts through its online &#147;Matcha Masterclass.&#148; 
          MatchaBar, a caf&eacute; devoted to all things green and tea-like in 
          Williamsburg, Brooklyn, offers matcha-making classes every Sunday at 
          7 P.M. (&#147;You get a discount if you come as a date,&#148; says co-owner 
          Graham Fortgang.) For $85&#151;$80 for couples or friends&#151;you get 
          hands-on instruction, as well as a matcha starter kit. &#147;We don&#146;t 
          actually make all that much money on the classes,&#148; says Fortgang. 
          &#147;But that&#146;s not the point. It&#146;s all about spreading the 
          knowledge.&#148;</p>
        <p><b>Matcha Out and About: The Rise of Matcha Caf&eacute;s</b><br>
          Although many coffee and tea houses serve some iteration of matcha, 
          there are a growing number across the country that specialize in traditionally-prepared 
          matcha. There are matcha caf&eacute;s in Portland, OR, Hong Kong, Hanoi, 
          Pasig, and San Diego.</p>
        <p>In addition to traditional coffee drinks, the menu at Chalait, a caf&eacute; 
          that opened on January 5th in Manhattan&#146;s West Village, features 
          matcha front-and-center on the menu. The green tea options at Chalait 
          are modeled after an espresso menu, with drinks like the americano, 
          cortado, and mocha. Although the caf&eacute; offers both tea and coffee, 
          the bar is separated into two distinct stations: One for matcha and 
          another for coffee. &#147;I wanted to really give our staff the space 
          to prepare it properly,&#148; explains co-owner Michelle Gardner, who 
          is so passionate about matcha that she quit her job in finance and enrolled 
          in the Institute of Culinary Education (ICE) before honing her chops 
          as a barista.</p>
        <p>A trip to Japan inspired Gardner, and her partner Ramon Puyani to open 
          their own caf&eacute; in the states. During their time in Kyoto, Puyani 
          tried his first cup of matcha; Gardner had been a longtime devotee. 
          They were both enchanted by the ritual method of preparing it&#151;as 
          well as its grassy, fresh flavor. Although they are careful to preserve 
          traditional preparation methods at Chalait, they also aim to present 
          the beverage in a manner that appeals to the Western palate and first-time 
          matcha consumers.</p>
        <p>&#147;We make each cup of matcha to order,&#148; explains Puyani, &#147;but 
          we serve it in an espresso mug [as opposed to the glass bowl]. It familiarizes 
          the experience.&#148; Chalait aims to make a morning mug of matcha as 
          much of a daily ritual for New Yorkers as a cup of joe. &#147;We hope 
          matcha will become to tea what espresso is to coffee,&#148; says Puyani&#151;essentially, 
          a way to deepen into the experience. And that&#146;s in large part why 
          Chalait is offering a full coffee bar of matcha options. Puyani&#146;s 
          initial question to first-time matcha drinkers is: &#147;How do you 
          take your coffee?&#148; If a customer tends to like it sweet and light, 
          he&#146;ll use matcha in a milky latte. If they&#146;re fans of black 
          espresso, they&#146;ll get the full monty: A matcha shot made with the 
          traditional whisk and hot water.</p>
        <p><b>#Matcha: It&#146;s a Lifestyle</b><br>
          MatchaBar, the half-year-old matcha caf&eacute; that&#146;s every bit 
          as cool as the Brooklyn neighborhood where it&#146;s located (Williamsburg, 
          of course), keeps the focus on matcha. Not only do co-owners and brothers 
          Graham and Max Fortgang serve the tea in many forms (lattes, shots, 
          etc.), they worship dutifully at the altar of powdered green tea leaves 
          themselves.</p>
        <p>Talk to Graham Fortgang about his caf&eacute; for any extended period 
          of time, and you&#146;ll hear the term &#147;Matcha Fam&#148; (short 
          for family) at least once. As in, &#147;We love our customers&#151;they&#146;re 
          our matcha fam,&#148; or &#147;Nothing makes me happier than seeing 
          the matcha fam come in all pumped about their day.&#148; The Fortgang 
          brothers are hardcore matcha enthusiasts, in part because it changed 
          their own lives.</p>
        <p>&#147;Before matcha, I was working in real estate and had my own event 
          production company. And I was also trying to graduate college. And&#133;&#148; 
          says Fortgang, who grew up in Manhattan and, despite speaking at a very 
          lively clip whenever the tea is mentioned, feels calmer and more centered 
          since embracing matcha. In addition to general feelings of anxiety and 
          stress, Fortgang suffered from acid reflux and a minor heart palpitation 
          which were both aggravated by his coffee and Red Bull consumption. He 
          decided to switch to matcha, and was immediately hooked. &#147;In the 
          modern world, people don&#146;t want to just be successful; they want 
          to be healthy in a sustained way,&#148; he says. It&#146;s this quality, 
          this pursuit of an all-around better-for-you lifestyle, that separates 
          the matcha sippers from the espresso shooters.</p>
        <p>Matcha isn&#146;t for everyone, but those who do embrace it really 
          embrace it. &#147;What&#146;s special about the matcha drinker prototype 
          is an openness to inviting a new ritual into their life,&#148; explains 
          Fortgang. &#147;We&#146;ve had a lot of converts who have totally switched 
          from coffee to matcha. To do that, you really have to believe you can. 
          Our biggest challenge is getting people to believe in an alternative. 
          It might not be matcha. But believing in an alternative puts you in 
          the right mindset.&#148;</p>
        <p><b>Big Tea: Have We Reached Maximum Matcha Saturation?</b><br>
          Because matcha has inspired so many wellness-conscious drinkers to explore 
          the tea, matcha-inspired and matcha-adjacent beverages are increasingly 
          available at caf&eacute;s, which makes Panatea&#146;s Lloyd both optimistic 
          and a little frustrated. &#147;The matcha you get at a chain coffee 
          shop is really just pure sugar. You can tell from the light color of 
          the drink.&#148; Pure matcha is a grassy, deep green color when prepared 
          in the old-world way.</p>
        <p>Is it inevitable that matcha will go the way of chai tea? Seasoned 
          chai enthusiasts will remember when the tea was an artisan novelty; 
          now syrupy chai-flavored lattes are poured from cardboard cartons at 
          every corner coffee shop. Lloyd appreciates large-batch matcha makers 
          for spreading the word and piquing an initial interest. Once a potential 
          matcha drinker tries a sweet matcha latte, she says, they&#146;re more 
          likely to branch out and try a straight cup, prepared traditionally.</p>
        <p>Despite the cult-like qualities of the matcha community, it&#146;s 
          a surprisingly open and collaborative community. Fortgang even cites 
          MatchaBar&#146;s competition as having a &#147;passionate, kind, open-arms 
          kind of attitude.&#148; And whether you&#146;ve been drinking it for 
          years or you&#146;re about to sip your first cup, rest assured: There&#146;s 
          a place for you in the Matcha Fam. Says Fortgang, &#147;My hope is that 
          my customer drinks their matcha and then goes out into the world. And 
          that day, whether they yell at their intern less, whether they fit in 
          a run at the end of their day, or whether they have a salad instead 
          of a crappy burger for lunch, I don&#146;t care. But one healthy habit 
          leads to another. Matcha is inspiring in that way.&#148;</p>
