        <p>Green tea has long been the magic potion of the health-conscious. It 
          is believed to be a cancer fighter, a stress reliever and a fat burner.</p>
        <p>Packed with antioxidants, it is considered the &#145;champagne of teas.&#146; 
          But, surprisingly, when you consume green tea, you get only half the 
          benefits. This is because the green tea that you drink is made of &#147;loose 
          leaf&#148; variety and some nutrients in the tea get tossed away unwittingly.</p>
        <p>Luckily, green tea chocolates tell a different story. The chocolate 
          uses rich &#145;matcha&#146; powder. Matcha is typically used for making 
          tea at traditional Japanese tea ceremonies, and it has a unique bitter-sweet 
          flavor that is ideal for chocolates.</p>
        <p>The matcha leaves, which are used in the green tea, are fully ground 
          and infused into the chocolate. These matcha leaves have more caffeine, 
          polyphenols, and antioxidants, including EGCG, and more L-Theanine than 
          the average green tea. According to the National Cancer Institute, the 
          catechins in matcha green tea are so powerful that it is believed that 
          they may actually help prevent cancer. Research also suggests that Matcha 
          have greater fat-burning capabilities than the regular green tea.</p>
        <p>The irresistible green tea bar is a guilt-free substitute to chocolate 
          and is equally hard to resist.</p>
        <p>A few companies like Meiji, Prestat, and Nestle do sell these green 
          chocolates, or you can try making your own at home.</p>
        <p>Riding on the wave of green tea craze, brands are doling out several 
          green tea-based desserts, such as green tea shakes, green tea cupcakes, 
          muffins and more.</p>
