        <p>You may have noticed a new green food taking over your Instagram feed 
          (yep, there are more green superfoods out there). That's matcha, one 
          of the buzziest food trends going, which makes it simultaneously intriguing 
          and insufferable. </p>
        <p>Matcha lovers say the powder has tons of superfood-like benefits. It 
          gives you the energy of Spider-Man! It keeps you looking young! You're 
          less likely to die if you drink it! But is there any truth behind these 
          claims, or are the benefits of matcha oversold?</p>
        <p>What the hell IS matcha? <br>
          Start with the basics. Matcha is made from whole green tea leaves ground 
          down into a powder. But it's not just any green tea; matcha comes from 
          special shade-grown tea leaves, with the shade resulting in boosted 
          chlorophyll levels and a deeper green hue. Traditionally, it's whisked 
          together with hot water until it makes a frothy tea drink. But today, 
          matcha is quickly making its way into trendy coffee shops, ice cream 
          parlors, and even hipster cocktail bars.</p>
        <p>Matcha is to green tea as smoothies are to juice<br>
          To understand matcha, you have to break down why it's unique. When you 
          juice fruits and vegetables, you're throwing a lot of the nutrients 
          in the trash. Green tea is similar, in that matcha is the full leaf. 
          By choosing matcha, you're not leaving any part of the leaf behind, 
          unlike green-tea bags, which are steeped then thrown away. </p>
        <p>It's crazy-packed with antioxidants<br>
          And you're getting all of them, since you're retaining the whole leaf. 
          One study found that matcha has at least three times the amount of catechins, 
          a kind of antioxidant, as the highest recorded value of green tea, meaning 
          many times more than the average cup. And as you know, antioxidants 
          help prevent cancer, heart disease, and more -- you'll probably live 
          forever if you drink matcha. Right? </p>
        <p>It boosts your endurance<br>
          Like coffee, green tea has been shown to enhance physical capacity. 
          Part of this is because of the caffeine, but it's also because green 
          tea is chock-full of those catechins already mentioned, which may improve 
          performance in athletic activities.</p>
        <p>It's great for weight management<br>
          Hang on, hang on, there's no sales pitch for &quot;Miracle Matcha Diet 
          Pills&quot; here. The good: drinking hot green tea is inversely related 
          to obesity. The bad: adding matcha powder to desserts and cocktails 
          does not cancel out the sugar or booze you're consuming. </p>
        <p>Not all matcha powders are equal<br>
          The highest-quality matcha usually comes from Japan, which is why Japanese 
          matcha is so pricey. Other countries, like China, are getting in on 
          matcha production, and the results are sometimes less than desirable 
          -- Chinese producers may not shade-grow the tea, and they've been known 
          to use banned pesticides, which probably negates a lot of matcha's health 
          benefits. </p>
        <p>Generally, the greener the matcha, the truer the product. Be sure to 
          check the ingredient label to make sure you're getting true tea -- some 
          pre-made drinks have so many added sugars and preservatives that they 
          barely qualify as matcha.</p>
        <p>CONTINUE READING<br>
          Beyond the pesticides, tea leaves grown in China may have high levels 
          of lead, and Americans are becoming pretty familiar with the problems 
          lead poses when people drink it. Consume too much, and you could end 
          up with liver damage way worse than anything you've experienced after 
          a boozy brunch. It's yet another reason to spend more for higher-quality 
          matcha.</p>
        <p>Does it live up to the hype? <br>
          If you're willing to drop a significant amount of money on your tea 
          habit, yes! A 0.7oz can of organic Japanese matcha, for example, could 
          cost you $12 before tax and shipping, and depending on how much you 
          drink, that could add up quickly. But the benefits are objectively positive. 
        </p>
        <p>If you're willing to take the plunge, there are infinite possibilities 
          for adding it to your routine. You could surely drink matcha the traditional 
          way, frothy and hot, or add it to a milk of your choice for a tasty 
          latte. But since matcha is a powder, it's easy to add to any recipe, 
          from muffins to puddings to granola -- the list goes on.</p>
