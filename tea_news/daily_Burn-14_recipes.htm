        <p>Seeing green? It&#146;s not just you. Matcha has taken the world by 
          storm. Head to Pinterest or Instagram and you&#146;re guaranteed to 
          see an array of emerald-hued dishes &#151; from matcha lattes to granola. 
          Plus, this trendy powder is packed with health benefits &#151; so we 
          understand why everybody&#146;s going green.</p>
        <p>Matcha is made from whole green tea leaves that have been pulverized 
          into a super fine powder. Research indicates that matcha powder has 
          significantly greater levels of antioxidants per serving than brewed 
          green tea. It also provides a mellow caffeine boost, allowing you to 
          energize without getting the jitters or the post-cuppa crash. Matcha&#146;s 
          ability to induce alertness can also be attributed to an amino acid 
          called L-Theanine, which is linked to promoting relaxation (but not 
          drowsiness). Bonus points: Matcha may also be more detoxifying than 
          regular green tea thanks to its high chlorophyll content.</p>
        <p>Before you head to the kitchen, take note: All matcha falls into one 
          of two categories, ceremony-grade and food-grade. While ceremony-grade 
          is considered higher quality and should be used for drinking, the food-grade 
          powder is intended for baking and cooking. That said, there&#146;s no 
          reason you can&#146;t use the ceremony-grade stuff in recipes, too, 
          and it often has a less bitter flavor than the powder typically used 
          in foods. Ready to get your green on?</p>
        <p><b>1. Matcha Crepes with Chocolate Ganache</b><br>
          Instagram these brightly-hued crepes and your friends will go green 
          with envy. The batter is packed with fiber, thanks to whole-grain buckwheat 
          flour, and you&#146;ll get a hefty dose of antioxidants from the matcha 
          powder you&#146;ll mix in. These crepes work perfectly at breakfast, 
          with some fresh fruit and whipped coconut cream. Or serve them for dessert, 
          with a simple dark chocolate and coconut milk ganache. (Recipe: Genevieve 
          / Gratitude &amp; Greens)</p>
        <p><b>2. Matcha Chia Seed Pudding</b><br>
          The only requirements for this easy breakfast or snack are chia seeds, 
          milk and matcha powder. (We recommend using almond milk, as it&#146;s 
          natural sweetness mellows the sometimes-grassy flavor of matcha.) From 
          there, add any mix-ins you like, from toasted nuts, to fresh fruit or 
          chocolate chips. (Recipe: Katelin / Nerdy Bites)</p>
        <p><b>3. Coconut Matcha Latte</b><br>
          Take one sip of this creamy, slightly earthy beverage and you&#146;ll 
          want to bid adieu to espresso-based lattes for life. The naturally sweet 
          and rich coconut milk will pair so well with your green powder that 
          you may never crave a pumpkin spice version again. (Recipe: Jeanine 
          / Love and Lemons)</p>
        <p><b>4. Healthy Matcha Green Tea Coconut Fudge</b><br>
          Healthy fudge? Now we&#146;ve seen everything. A combination of cottage 
          cheese and psyllium husk give this treat a healthy dose of protein and 
          fiber. Coconut butter lends a luscious texture, while shredded coconut, 
          matcha powder and stevia create a subtly sweet flavor. (Recipe: Jessica 
          / Desserts with Benefits)</p>
        <p><b>5. Matcha Granola with Blueberries</b><br>
          On its own, matcha can have an intense, sometimes bitter taste. In this 
          green granola recipe, roasted nuts and juicy blueberries do wonders 
          to tone down its strong green flavor. Plus, serve it up for breakfast 
          and you&#146;ll get that much-needed a.m. caffeine boost. (Recipe: Cheryl 
          / 40 Aprons)</p>
        <p><b>6. Matcha Mochi Yogurt Pops</b><br>
          Matcha and mochi are a match made in heaven. In these healthy treats, 
          tart yogurt balances the grassy matcha flavor while bits of chewy, sweet 
          mochi add some texture to each pop. (Recipe: Molly / My Name is Yeh)</p>
        <p><b>7. Vanilla Matcha Protein Smoothie</b><br>
          Matcha is the ideal addition to a pre-workout shake thanks to its mellow 
          caffeine boost and ability to promote &#147;calm alertness.&#148; This 
          mix has a subtle green tea flavor that&#146;s complemented by the addition 
          of a vanilla bean. (Recipe: Perry Santanachote / Life by DailyBurn)</p>
        <p><b>8. Dark Chocolate Matcha Date Bars</b><br>
          Wrap one of these in some parchment paper and tuck it away for a healthy 
          afternoon snack. Sweet dates and rich cocoa powder combine nicely with 
          this earthy matcha powder topping. The caramel-like taste of dates will 
          be a welcome change from the more acute sweetness of white sugar found 
          in many bars. (Recipe: Denise / Little Market Kitchen)</p>
        <p><b>9. Matcha Green Tea Mug Cake</b><br>
          When you&#146;re craving dessert but want to avoid a sugar coma, this 
          easy mug cake is your answer. The recipe calls for white sugar but any 
          healthier alternative would stand in just fine &#151; we&#146;d suggest 
          trying coconut sugar or agave. The cake should come out only slight 
          sweet, but feel free to reduce the amount of sugar you use to suit your 
          taste. (Recipe: Kirbie / Kirbie Cravings)</p>
        <p><b>10. Chocolate Matcha Butter Cups</b><br>
          Move over, peanut butter cups. Coconut butter and matcha powder combine 
          with a bit of almond flour to create the drool-worthy soft yet slightly 
          chewy center in this rich morsel. Don&#146;t skip out on the matcha-sea 
          salt topping! (Recipe: Keepin&#146; It Kind)</p>
        <p><b>11. Matcha Muffins</b><br>
          These protein, fiber and antioxidant-rich muffins make a great breakfast 
          or mid-morning snack (if you need a little pick-me-up). The best part? 
          They&#146;re just 105 calories per muffin, and they&#146;re gluten-free. 
          (Recipe: Elizabeth /Guilty Kitchen)</p>
        <p><b>12. Miso Eggplant with Green Tea Rice</b><br>
          Leave it to the folks at Blue Apron to come up with this insanely innovative 
          way to use matcha. In this recipe, sushi rice gets an upgrade with the 
          addition of rice vinegar, matcha powder, cilantro and black sesame seeds. 
          The result is a healthy, flavorful and beautiful base for this Asian-inspired 
          roasted eggplant. (Recipe: Blue Apron)</p>
        <p><b>13. Matcha Cucumber Lemonade</b><br>
          Forget the super sweet, sugar-packed lemonade of your youth. This healthier 
          nutrient-packed version is about to find a spot in your regular beverage 
          rotation. Cucumber, mint and matcha add subtle, refreshing flavors, 
          while a hint of agave helps sweeten the mixture just enough. (Recipe: 
          Perry Santanachote / Life by DailyBurn)</p>
        <p><b>14. Green Tea Coconut Ice Cream</b><br>
          A mainstay on Japanese dessert menus, green tea ice cream is one of 
          the most common ways you&#146;ll see matcha used. Forego the usual dairy-and-sugar 
          filled calorie bomb with this recipe that uses coconut and almond milks 
          to create a creamy base. Honey and dates add sweetness without all the 
          refined sugar. (Recipe: Minimalist Baker)</p>
