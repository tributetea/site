        <p align="left">WASHINGTON (AP) - An ordinary cup of tea may be a powerful 
          infection fighter, a study suggests. </p>
        <p align="left">Researchers report in the Proceedings of the National 
          Academy of Sciences that they have found in tea a chemical that boosts 
          the body's defense fivefold against disease. </p>
        <p align="left">They said the chemical primes immune system cells to attack 
          bacteria, viruses and fungi and could, perhaps, be turned into a disease-fighting 
          drug someday. </p>
        <p align="left">Jack Bukowski of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston 
          and Harvard Medical School said Monday that he and his co-authors isolated 
          the chemical in the laboratory and then proved with a group of volunteers 
          that it did protect against germs. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;We worked out the molecular aspects of this tea 
          component in the test tube and then tested it on a small number of people 
          to see if it actually worked in human beings,&quot; said Bukowski. The 
          results, he said, gave clear proof that five cups of tea a day sharpened 
          the body's defenses against disease. </p>
        <p align="left">Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition specialist at Pennsylvania 
          State University, said Bukowski's study adds to a growing body of evidence 
          that tea is an effective disease fighter. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;This is potentially a very significant finding,&quot; 
          she said. &quot;We're seeing multiple benefits from tea.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">But she said the work needs to be confirmed in a much 
          larger study, involving more people. </p>
        <p align="left">In the study, Bukowski and his co-authors isolated from 
          ordinary black tea a substance called L-theanine. He said the substance 
          is found as well in green and oolong tea, which also are processed from 
          traditional tea tree leaves. </p>
        <p align="left">Bukowski said L-theanine is broken down in the liver to 
          ethylamine, a molecule that primes the response of an immune blood cell 
          called the gamma-delta T cell. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;We know from other studies that these gamma-delta 
          T cells in the blood are the first line of defense against many types 
          of bacteria, viral, fungal and parasitic infections,&quot; he said. 
          &quot;They even have some anti-tumor activity.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">The T cells prompt the secretion of interferon, a key 
          part of the body's chemical defense against infection, Bukowski said. 
        </p>
        <p align="left"> &quot;We know from mouse studies that if you boost this 
          part of the immune system it can protect against infection,&quot; he 
          said. </p>
        <p align="left">To further test the finding, the researchers had 11 volunteers 
          drink five cups a day of tea, and 10 others drink coffee. Before the 
          test began, they drew blood samples from all 21 test subjects. </p>
        <p align="left">After four weeks, they took more blood from the tea drinkers 
          and then exposed that blood to the bacteria called E-coli. Bukowski 
          said the immune cells in the specimens secreted five times more interferon 
          than did blood cells from the same subjects before the weeks of tea 
          drinking. Blood tests and bacteria challenges showed there was no change 
          in the interferon levels of the coffee drinkers, he said. </p>
        <p align="left">Bukowski said it may be possible to further isolate and 
          refine L-theanine from tea and use that as a drug to boost the infection 
          defense of the body. </p>
        <p align="left">The health effects of tea have been extensively studied. 
          It has been linked to lower heart disease and cancer risk through the 
          action of flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. Other studies have linked 
          tea to helping combat osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease, and to 
          relieving some allergy symptoms. <br>
