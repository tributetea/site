          <b><font color="#990000">TEA COULD REDUCE RISK OF CIRCULATORY DISEASE<br>
          </font></b><font color="#000000">-Dr. Steve Salvatore</font></p>
        <p align="left">NEW YORK - Tea drinkers take heart. People who drink tea 
          each day significantly reduce their chances of atherosclerosis, or hardening 
          of the arteries, according to a study published this week in the Archives 
          of Internal Medicine. </p>
        <p align="left">Those who drank one or two cups a day lowered their risk 
          by 46 percent. For those who drank four cups a day, the risk dropped 
          by 69 percent. <br>
          Women seem to benefit more by drinking tea, the second most consumed 
          beverage in the world after water. And adding milk, honey, lemon or 
          sugar do not diminish the positive health effects, experts said.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;If can be linked directly that consumption of tea 
          prevents development of blockages, then obviously tea would become a 
          very important part of our dietary counseling for patients who have 
          heart trouble or are at risk for heart attack or stroke,&quot; said 
          Dr. David Vorchheimer of the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. </p>
        <p align="left">The beneficial effects of tea are probably due to bio- 
          flavanoids, natural substances that act as powerful anti- oxidants, 
          limiting the effects of free radicals in the body. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Free radicals are very damaging because they can 
          trigger a chain reaction,&quot; said Dr. Michael Gaziano of Brigham 
          &amp; Women's Hospital. &quot;One free radical can damage thousands 
          and thousands of lipid molecules. So the reaction, we like to stop it 
          early on in the process.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">Most studies supporting the health benefits of tea have 
          concerned black tea, the most widely consumed tea in the world. Green 
          tea also has anti-oxidant properties, but experts say more research 
          is needed. </p>
        <p align="left">&quot;If you have 1 or 2 percent of the population drinking 
          one kind of herbal tea, and 1 or 2 percent of the population drinking 
          another kind of herbal tea, it might be very difficult for us to see 
          any kind of association given those small numbers,&quot; said Gaziano. 
        </p>
        <p align="left">Researchers caution that more studies would be necessary 
          to determine if tea is directly responsible for the health benefits. 
        </p>
        <p align="left"> &quot;The tea itself might have had nothing to do with 
          the prevention of heart attacks. The tea might have been a marker for 
          patients who live a healthy lifestyle, people who avoid caffeine, who 
          don't smoke, who exercise,&quot; said Vorchheimer. </p>
        <p align="left">Although tea has caffeine, most doctors see no reason 
          why people should stop drinking it. Caffeine can increase heart rate 
          and blood pressure, but a cup or two a day of tea, which has half the 
          caffeine of coffee, probably will not hurt.</p>
