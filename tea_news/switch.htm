          is mounting that black, green, and oolong tea <br>
          have important health benefits.</font></i></b></font></p>
        <p align="left">While tea drinking is embellished with great ceremony 
          in such places as Japan, China, and Great Britain, in the more hurrying 
          culture of the U.S., tea is viewed as just another beverage. Americans 
          drink 85 percent of their tea iced. And the brew is much less popular 
          than soft drinks, beer, coffee, milk, fruit beverages, or bottled water.</p>
        <p align="left">Yet drinking tea-hot or iced-may be an easy, pleasurable 
          way to get some serious health benefits. A number of recent studies 
          add support to earlier findings about the benefits of tea and reveal 
          some possible new ones. The evidence for those benefits is strongest 
          for green tea, mainly because the green brew has been studied more than 
          the others.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Stronger bones?</i></b> Tea drinking may increase 
          bone-mineral density and so, theoretically, could protect against osteoporosis. 
          Two recent studies from China and Great Britain report higher bone-density 
          measurements among tea drinkers. The Chinese study, which included over 
          1,000 participants age 30 and over, found that those adults who had 
          been drinking tea regularly for 6 to 10 years had higher lumbar-spine 
          bone-mineral density than those who didn't partake of the brew. Those 
          who had been regular tea drinkers for more than 10 years had the highest 
          bone density in all sites measured. Most of the tea drinkers in this 
          study drank green or oolong tea, but some did drink black tea. Interestingly, 
          the key variable was how long tea drinkers had been consuming tea, not 
          how much or what type they drank each day. Additionally, in a study 
          of more than 1,200 British women over age 65, current tea drinkers-whether 
          they sipped one cup or more than six cups a day-had higher bone-density 
          measurements than non-tea drinkers.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Healthier heart?</i></b> Dutch researchers reported 
          in May that tea drinkers had a substantially lower risk of heart attack-particularly 
          fatal ones-than those who don't drink tea. That study included nearly 
          5,000 adults age 55 and older. Those participants who drank over 11 
          ounces of black tea daily had about half the risk of heart attack and 
          less than one-third the risk of fatal heart attack compared with nondrinkers. 
          Another study, also published in May, this one from the Harvard School 
          of Public Health, looked at patient-survival rates after a heart attack. 
          The more tea that patients drank in the year before their heart attack, 
          the better their chances of surviving in the years after. Participants 
          were divided into moderate drinkers (fewer than 14 cups per week), heavy 
          drinkers (14 or more cups weekly), and nondrinkers. Moderate drinkers 
          had a 28 percent lower death rate after heart attack than nondrinkers, 
          and heavy drinkers had a 44 percent lower death rate than those who 
          didn't drink tea. Those results held up after researchers adjusted for 
          such factors as age, smoking, obesity, and hypertension.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Improved arteries?</i></b> Researchers from the 
          Boston University School of Medicine report that both short- and long-term 
          tea drinking appear to improve blood-vessel functioning in patients 
          with coronary heart disease. In that clinical trial, researchers measured 
          the effects of black tea on the arteries of 50 coronary patients. Tea 
          improved artery functioning and seemed to reverse atherosclerosis, which 
          can lead to heart attack and stroke. An earlier Dutch study of more 
          than 3,400 people without cardiovascular disease found that the risk 
          of developing severe atherosclerosis was 46 and 69 percent lower in 
          participants who drank one to two cups or more than four cups of tea 
          per day, respectively. Those protective effects were particularly evident 
          in women.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>Cancer fighter?</i></b> Recent research supports 
          earlier findings that tea may have cancer-protective qualities. Some 
          promising findings were presented in April 2002 at the annual meeting 
          of the American Association for Cancer Research. A large study of over 
          18,000 Chinese men revealed that tea drinkers were about half as likely 
          to develop stomach or esophageal cancer as non-tea drinkers. Another 
          Chinese study found that people who drank one to three cups of green 
          tea a day had an apparent 30 percent reduction in their risk of developing 
          stomach cancer; the risk reduction jumped to 61 percent for people who 
          drank more than three cups daily. And a study published in June suggests 
          that tea drinking may possibly have a protective effect on cancer, particularly 
          in men. However, a recent Japanese study of over 26,000 people found 
          no link between drinking green tea and protection from gastric cancer.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>HOW TEA MAY FIGHT DISEASE<br>
          </i></b>The three nonherbal teas-black, green, and oolong-all come from 
          the same plant, Camellia sinensis. Their differences lie in the processing: 
          Heating the leaves immediately after they've been chopped minimizes 
          certain chemical changes and produces green tea; a brief delay in heating 
          yields oolong tea, and a longer delay yields black tea.</p>
        <p align="left">All three forms of Camellia sinensis are unusually rich 
          in a potent class of antioxidants called polyphenols. Antioxidants are 
          important because they neutralize harmful free radicals, the highly 
          unstable molecules produced by the body's normal metabolism and by exposure 
          to chemicals, heavy metals, radiation, and the like. Lacking a vital 
          part of their molecular structure, free radicals oxidize other molecules 
          by snatching the missing part from them. That process can damage the 
          body's cells, proteins, and fats-and, in theory, can help cause a wide 
          range of diseases and possibly even hasten aging. To minimize the damage, 
          the body uses antioxidants-some produced internally, others gleaned 
          from food and drink-to help neutralize the radicals.</p>
        <p align="left">In theory, antioxidants can protect against disease and 
          may help to explain why tea drinkers tend to be healthier. In laboratory 
          and animal studies, the antioxidants in tea have been shown to help 
          check the formation of certain carcinogenic compounds, disrupt several 
          tumor-promoting enzymes, kill or at least slow the growth of actual 
          cancer cells while leaving normal cells unscathed, and prevent normal 
          cells from turning cancerous, mainly by shielding their DNA from oxidative 
          damage.</p>
        <p align="left">Other laboratory studies suggest that tea may help protect 
          the heart by relaxing blood vessels; by inhibiting blood clots, which 
          can trigger a heart attack or stroke; by shielding the &quot;bad&quot; 
          LDL cholesterol from the oxidative damage that makes it stick to the 
          walls of coronary arteries; and possibly by helping to improve blood-cholesterol 
          levels. Other compounds in tea include fluoride and phytoestrogens, 
          which researchers speculate may favorably affect bone-mineral density.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>HOT, COLD, OR DECAF?</i></b><br>
          When Consumer Reports tested teas in November 1999, bagged green and 
          black teas scored high in antioxidant content, a key indicator of potential 
          health value. Even the powdered instant teas and ready-to-drink iced 
          teas contained a good deal of antioxidants, though not as much as fresh-brewed 
          tea.</p>
        <p align="left">Brewed tea appears to have more antioxidant action than 
          almost any whole fruit or vegetable-and more than most commercial fruit 
          or vegetable juices, too. Other research shows that adding milk, sugar, 
          or lemon to tea does not destroy antioxidants or block their absorption 
          by the body.</p>
        <p align="left">While tea is a generally benign beverage without harmful 
          side effects, it does contain caffeine. Black tea has one-half or less 
          of the caffeine in coffee, and green tea contains somewhat less than 
          black.</p>
        <p align="left">Decaffeinated tea appears to be almost as rich in antioxidants 
          as the caffeinated form, so decaf may be a better choice for people 
          with hypertension, irregular heart rhythms, or anxiety or panic attacks. 
          If you're pregnant or nursing, you may want to avoid caffeine because 
          it can cause abnormal heart rhythms in the fetus or jittery behavior 
          in the infant.</p>
        <p align="left">Also be aware that caffeine interacts with certain drugs-such 
          as birth-control pills and certain heart and thyroid medications, antidepressants, 
          and sedatives; check the package insert of any drugs you're taking.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>SUMMING UP</i></b><br>
          While the evidence of the health benefits of traditional tea is mounting, 
          it's not yet clear whether it's the tea itself or other factors that 
          result in the lower disease risks of frequent tea drinkers. Nonetheless, 
          since drinking tea is safe, convenient, and inexpensive, there's little 
          downside and possible health benefits for those who enjoy the beverage.</p>
        <p align="left">There is not yet enough evidence to make recommendations 
          about how much of which type of tea to drink. But don't think of tea 
          as a substitute for eating a varied diet rich in fruits and vegetables. 
          The evidence that produce helps prevent disease is far stronger than 
          the evidence for tea.</p>
        <p align="left"><b><i>OTHER BEVERAGES<br>
          </i></b>Tea is not the only beverage that contains antioxidants. Cocoa 
          and coffee-especially the strong brews favored by French consumers-typically 
          have higher antioxidant activity than green or black tea, according 
          to a study from the Nestl&eacute;' Research Center in Switzerland. (Herbal 
          teas chamomile, lime flower, mint, rosehip, and verveine--had by far 
          the least antioxidant power.) Coffee and cocoa are both rich in polyphenols, 
          the same class of antioxidants that gives nonherbal tea its apparent 
          disease-fighting powers. However, the evidence from the type of nutritional 
          studies conducted on tea drinkers indicates that coffee and cocoa have 
          only a tepid positive effect in humans. Other beverages that have high 
          to moderately high antioxidant power include grape juice, red wine, 
          tomato juice, and orange juice.<br>
