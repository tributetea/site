        <p align="left">In the most basic terms, matcha is a special kind of green 
          tea. It&#146;s also quickly becoming a popular cocktail ingredient at 
          bars across the country.</p>
        <p align="left">&#147;Unlike most teas in which the leaves are steeped 
          in hot water and then strained out, with matcha you are actually drinking 
          the leaves,&#148; says Mike Lu of Estrellon in Madison, Wisconsin. The 
          tea leaves are dried, aged, turned into a powder and made into a solution, 
          traditionally by mixing about a teaspoon of matcha powder with a third 
          a cup of hot water (heated to less than a boil), which is then whisked 
          with a bamboo brush until it froths.</p>
        <p>Generally, matcha is used in cocktails in its powder form due to its 
          strong, bold, earthy, and bitter flavors. &#147;As a powder, it is so 
          easily malleable that it works well as infusions with alcohol, or in 
          syrups for sweeteners,&#148; says Lu. You can still feel healthy while 
          you get drunk, because it also contains caffeine and is well-known for 
          its health benefits. &#147;Who wouldn&#146;t want a cocktail that makes 
          you feel great, and is (kind of) good for you?&#148;</p>
        <p>Matcha is a delicate, finely ground powder made from shade-grown green 
          tea leaves. &#147;The process originated in China, and it requires particular 
          farming practices and rituals- the whole process starts several weeks 
          before harvest and takes up to twenty days to get the fine, bright green 
          talc we use,&#148; says Spirit Guide Nandini Khaund from Cindy&#146;s 
          in Chicago.</p>
        <p>First, they cover the tea bushes to slow down growth and stimulate 
          chlorophyll levels, resulting in a richer green color and an increase 
          in amino acids. &#147;Each bud is handpicked, unfurled and laid out 
          to dry.&#148; Then it is de-stemmed, de-veined, and slowly ground at 
          just the right temperature in order not to lose aroma. &#147;It takes 
          an hour to get 30 grams of matcha.&#148;</p>
        <p>For centuries it was used in rituals and is gaining in popularity in 
          the cocktail world because of its flavor and health benefits. &#147;It 
          is high in antioxidants and wakes you up in a clear-headed way.&#148;</p>
        <p>One cup of matcha has the power of ten cups of mere mortal green tea. 
          &#147;It boosts metabolism, it is rich in vitamins and minerals, it 
          lowers cholesterol, and it has the highest natural concentration of 
          a unique form of antioxidants (the catechin EGCg)- which may be a champion 
          in fighting cancer,&#148; says Khaund. &#147;Also, it is a very elegant 
          buzz.&#148;</p>
        <p>Bartenders enjoy working with it because it&#146;s incredibly flexible, 
          so it works well within the sweet and savory range of flavors. &#147;I 
          find it works best with citrus flavors (lime, lemon, or its japanese 
          counterpar yuzu) or egg whites,&#148; says Lu. &#147;The flavor is earthy 
          and slightly bitter, and it has a really cool color,&#148; says Khaund.</p>
        <p>Lu uses it in a cocktail called &#147;86 Lu&#148;, it&#146;s a variant 
          on the Ramos gin fizz, containing lemon, lime, cream, egg white, vodka, 
          soda, and matcha powder.</p>
        <p>Khaund says that when you&#146;re done with cocktails, matcha is also 
          a great baking ingredient. &#147;Matcha and chocolate are great together.&#148; 
          The green tea complements nutty flavors such as almond. &#147;But, it 
          can withstand pairings with fruit as well.&#148; She adds, &#147;Banana-matcha 
          smoothies are pretty great too.&#148;</p>
        <p>She makes a cocktail using the highest quality matcha from the Shizuoka 
          prefecture in Japan. &#147;It&#146;s the &#145;first flush&#146;, the 
          first spring leaves from the top of the bush that have received most 
          of the plant&#146;s energy, a very high grade matcha.&#148;</p>
        <p>First, she prepares a matcha honey almond milk latte. &#147;The addition 
          of Lazzaroni Amaretto provides the &#145;almond/lemon cookie&#146; hint 
          while the Tanqueray Old Tom gin elevates it with delicate malt and floral 
          botanical notes.&#148;</p>
        <p>Khaund believes that a good matcha is totally worth it. &#147;I wish 
          I could say it wasn&#146;t, but it is not cheap. The flavor is much 
          more nuanced- it tastes as fragrantly green as the amount of green you 
          have to spend to get it.&#148;</p>
