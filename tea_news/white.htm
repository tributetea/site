          PROPERTIES</font></b><font size="-1"><b><font color="#990000"><br>

        <p align="left">CLEVELAND - Scientists at University Hospitals of Cleveland 
          and Case Western Reserve University have proven that ingredients in 
          white tea are effective in boosting the immune function of skin cells 
          and protecting them against the damaging effects of the sun. The discovery 
          that white tea extract protects the skin from oxidative stress and immune 
          cell damage adds another important element in the battle against skin 
          cancer.</p>
        <p align="left">Elma Baron, MD, is Director of the Skin Study Center at 
          UHC and CWRU. &quot;We found the application of white tea extract protects 
          critical elements of the skin's immune system, &quot; Dr. Baron says. 
          &quot;Similar to the way oxidation causes a car to rust, oxidative stress 
          of the skin causes a breakdown in cellular strength and function. The 
          white tea extract protects against this stress. This study further demonstrates 
          the importance of researching how plant products can actually protect 
          the skin.&quot; Dr. Baron worked with Seth Stevens, MD, principal investigator 
          for the study. </p>
        <p align="left">As part of the study, scientists applied a white tea extract 
          cream to one patch of skin on the subject's buttock (skin that is not 
          ordinarily exposed to much sunlight), while another area was left unprotected. 
          Both areas were then exposed to artificial sunlight. Researchers then 
          reapplied the white tea extract to the area previously coated. Three 
          days later the scientists compared the patches of skin on a cellular 
          level. </p>
        <p align="left">Here's what they looked for: In the immune system, the 
          Langerhans cells in the outer layer of the skin (epidermis) are the 
          outermost reach of the immune system, and are the first to recognize 
          foreign agents. They are the sentinel cells or watchdog cells, essential 
          in detecting germs and mutated proteins produced by cancerous cells; 
          but, because of their location, the Langerhans cells are very sensitive 
          to damage by sunlight. Scientists in the study found the white tea extract 
          protected against the Langerhans cell obliteration that was observed 
          in the sun-exposed skin not treated with the extract. The investigators 
          then tested whether the preserved immune system cells in the white tea 
          extract-protected skin would still function properly after exposure 
          to sunlight; they discovered the immune function was indeed restored 
          by the extract. They also found that the DNA damage that can occur in 
          cells after exposure to sunlight was limited in the skin cells protected 
          by the white tea extract. </p>
        <p align="left">Researchers believe that white tea extract's anti-oxidant 
          properties are the reason the extract was effective; if so, it also 
          suggests that the agent may provide anti-aging benefits. The same process 
          of oxidative stress in skin cells that leads to immune system damage 
          can also promote skin cancer and photo damage, such as wrinkling or 
          mottled pigmentation. </p>
        <p align="left">Kevin Cooper, MD, is chairman of the department of dermatology 
          at UHC and CWRU. &quot;We know that younger skin tends to be able to 
          resist the oxidative stress associated with exposure to the destructive 
          rays of sunlight. The white tea extract also appears to build the skin's 
          resistance against stresses that cause the skin to age.&quot; </p>
        <p align="left">The results offer promise in the battle against skin cancer, 
          the most common form of cancer in the United States with more than one 
          million new cases diagnosed every year. </p>
        <p align="left">The Skin Study Center at UHC and CWRU has studied the 
          benefits of another form of tea that has protective effects. Researchers 
          found that ingredients in green tea decreased the direct effects of 
          sunburn. This newest study is the first of its kind involving white 
          tea. White and green teas contain the highest amounts of antioxidants 
          of all tea varieties, but white tea is actually the least processed 
          form of tea and is rarely used in consumer products.<br>
