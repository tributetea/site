        <p><b><i>June&#146;s National Iced Tea Month Commemorates 100 Years of 
          Iced Tea <br>
          - Ever-growing Body of Research Indicates Even More Reasons to Drink-</i></b> 
        </p>
        <p>NEW YORK &#150; The quintessential English tradition of &#147;taking 
          tea&#148; was forever changed 100 years ago, when plantation owner Richard 
          Blechynden was inspired to pour brewed tea over ice at the 1904 World&#146;s 
          Fair in St. Louis, creating an American phenomenon. It was a particularly 
          hot summer day and customers were uninterested in the hot tea Blechynden 
          was serving, so he poured the delicious beverage over ice. Since then, 
          people around the world have delighted in tasty, refreshing iced tea 
          and have made it one of America&#146;s favorite beverages.</p>
        <p>Today, iced tea continues to be one of the country&#146;s most beloved 
          beverages, especially among those looking for a refreshing antioxidant 
          boost. Drinking a tall glass of iced tea may offer more than just a 
          thirst quencher. Many population studies and other scientific research 
          suggest a connection between drinking tea regularly and a variety of 
          potential health benefits, including: </p>
        <p>1. Cardiovascular health benefits, including reduced risk of heart 
          attack, stroke and other forms of heart disease <br>
          2. Reduced risk of certain cancers, including colorectal and skin cancers 
          <br>
          3. Benefits to bone health, as researchers have noted a correlation 
          between long-time tea drinkers and stronger bones <br>
          4. Oral health benefits, as researchers believe certain compounds in 
          tea may inhibit bacteria that cause bad breath and plaque, and the fluoride 
          content in tea supports healthy tooth enamel <br>
        </p>
        <p>Healthy immune function, which researchers believe results from a compound 
          in black tea called L-theanine which may support the immune system&#146;s 
          natural resistance to infection and perhaps even tumors. </p>
        <p>&#147;Research suggests that tea drinking may offer a wide array of 
          potential health benefits in a great-tasting and convenient beverage,&#148; 
          says Joseph Simrany, President of the Tea Council of the USA. &#147;Why 
          not celebrate iced tea&#146;s centennial by toasting a tall glass to 
          your health throughout National Iced Tea Month this June?&#148; </p>
