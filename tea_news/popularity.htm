        <p align="left">Millions of Americans still reach for that first cup of 
          coffee to get them going in the morning, but tea is making inroads into 
          the java market.</p>
        <p align="left">National tea sales have climbed from just over $1 billion 
          to about $5.1 billion over the last decade, according to the Tea Council 
          of the USA, a trade group. And it's not just traditional black and orange 
          pekoe tea behind that growth - more people are buying green and specialty 
          teas.</p>
        <p align="left">Tea's rising popularity has encouraged entrepreneurs to 
          open tea shops around the country, even in rural communities such as 
          Newton, N.J.; Carefree, Ariz.; and Anoka, Minn., where people sit for 
          a while and enjoy a pot or a cup. And even in coffee-loving Seattle.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Tea is for fun,&quot; said Susan Zuege, co-owner 
          of the Perennial Tea Room, located in Post Alley, near this city's famous 
          Pike Place Market and the original Starbucks coffee shop. &quot;You 
          should enjoy it. If you don't, you might as well do coffee.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Lipton is by far the best-selling brand of tea in the 
          country with more than 50 percent of the market, and also leads the 
          bottled and canned tea industry with 33.4 percent of sales, according 
          to 2002 figures from Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York.</p>
        <p align="left">Mike Spillane, owner of G.S. Haley Company Inc., a tea 
          wholesaler in Redwood City, Calif., said specialty teas are also growing 
          in popularity.</p>
        <p align="left">Baby boomers, looking to move away from traditional coffee 
          drinks, have likely helped feed into the tea frenzy, Spillane said. 
          And the emergence of bottled, ready-to-drink teas have brought tea to 
          younger people who normally view it as a drink for the older generation, 
          he said.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;It has legitimatized the word 'tea' to the youth,&quot; 
          Spillane.</p>
        <p align="left">Most Americans use tea bags, although loose tea is making 
          strides among the specialty tea sector, said Joseph Simrany, president 
          of the New York-based Tea Council. &quot;It's convenience that's winning 
          out over flavor delivery. Americans still love their convenience,&quot; 
          he said.</p>
        <p align="left">Tea bag sales nationwide have increased by about 6 percent 
          in the last five years, according to recent numbers from Information 
          Resources Inc., a Chicago-based market research firm.</p>
        <p align="left">Meanwhile, tea shops have sprung up throughout the United 
          States and currently number about 1,200.</p>
        <p align="left">In Woodbury, Conn., Mrs. White's Tea Room has been catering 
          to its regulars' affluent tastes for almost five years, owner Tom Winters 
          said. He bought the shop from a friend about a year ago and said he 
          was &quot;surprised how many people drink tea.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Just as Winters has broadened his knowledge of the product, 
          so too have his customers, who are about 95 percent women.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;They're more in tune to more than just a plain Earl 
          Grey,&quot; he said. &quot;They're trying the Chinese Lychee ... and 
          more people are trying the green teas, seeking the benefits.&quot;</p>
        <p align="left">Health is perhaps one of the biggest driving forces behind 
          tea's acclaim. </p>
        <p align="left">Green tea is best known for its health benefits, primarily 
          because some of the first studies on tea's health attributes came out 
          of Japan and China, where that particular type is widely consumed, said 
          Dr. Jeffrey Blumberg, professor of nutrition at Tufts University in 
          Boston.</p>
        <p align="left">All tea, however, comes from the same camellia sinensis 
          plant, with how the leaves are processed determining the different types 
          of tea.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;Black tea has similar properties but has not gotten 
          as much attention,&quot; Blumberg said.</p>
        <p align="left">A recent study by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital 
          in Boston and Harvard medical School showed that tea, unlike coffee, 
          boosts the body's immune system to fight infection. It also showed blood 
          cells from tea drinkers responded five times faster to germs than did 
          those of coffee drinkers.</p>
        <p align="left">A study published last year by the American Heart Association 
          journal Circulation showed that people who drank large amounts of tea 
          - about 19 cups a week - also were less likely to die after a heart 
          attack.</p>
        <p align="left">Tea boasts a range of benefits, including health and flavor, 
          that culminate to provide people with a relaxing experience, said Cindi 
          Bigelow, vice president of R.C. Bigelow Tea.</p>
        <p align="left">Connecticut-based Bigelow Tea was started in 1945 when 
          the company launched its Constant Comment brand. The company now offers 
          dozens of flavored teas and sells honey, gift sets and other products.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;It's just a great way to take a moment for yourself 
          during the day to do something that's good for the mind, the body and 
          the spirit,&quot; Bigelow said.</p>
        <p align="left">Many people also ascribe a mystical quality to tea. So 
          at Bottom of the Cup Tea Room in New Orleans' French Quarter, customers 
          who cozy up to a cup of tea can both drink from the leaves and have 
          them read. The fourth-generation shop opened in 1929 and has always 
          offered fortune telling as part of its tea experience.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;You already have the old world charm, the antiquity 
          of the French quarter. This adds to that,&quot; owner Tom Mullen said.
