        <p align="left">Matcha, matcha, matcha - there seems to be nothing this 
          ancient, green super powder can't do. </p>
        <p>It's been enjoyed for centuries in China and Japan where Buddhists 
          sipped it to prepare for Zen meditation. </p>
        <p>Now it's in everything from iced tea and lattes to face masks, smoothies, 
          raw desserts, puddings, ice cream, cookies, donuts, salad dressing and 
          more.</p>
        <p>And that's because matcha powder - made from green tea leaves that 
          are steamed and air dried then ground to a powder soon after harvest 
          - is so good for you. Here's why:</p>
        <p><i>It has anti-aging, antioxidant super powers... </i><br>
          Further proof of matcha's super powers is it has an ORAC (Oxygen Radical 
          Absorbance Capacity or total antioxidant capacity) value of 1348 units 
          per gram compared to pomegranate's 105 u/g and blueberries 91 u/g.</p>
        <p>And while the antioxidant power of regular green tea is well known, 
          just one cup of matcha has 10 times the antioxidants of a cup of green 
          or black tea.</p>
        <p><i>It's a mood and concentration enhancer...</i><br>
          Matcha has only half as much caffeine as your average cup of coffee. 
        </p>
        <p>It also boosts your mood and the alpha waves in your brain, encouraging 
          clear, calm thinking, thanks to an amino acid called L theanine which 
          plays a role in our production of the feel-good hormones dopamine and 
          serotonin.</p>
        <p><i>It boosts metabolism and fat burning...</i><br>
          A 2005 study by the Amercian Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that 
          matcha boosts your metabolic rate and increases thermogenesis, which 
          is when your body burns calories to create heat.</p>
        <p><i>It helps prevent cancer and other chronic diseases...</i><br>
          Matcha is rich in polyphenol compounds that help lower your risk of 
          developing chronic diseases including cancer and diabetes (because it 
          improves insulin sensitivity). </p>
        <p><i>It keeps your heart healthy...</i><br>
          The plant polyphenols found in matcha also help prevent hardening of 
          the arteries which can lead to heart attack and stroke.</p>
        <p>Drinking matcha or green tea daily has also been shown to lower blood 
          pressure because it inhibits the production of ACE - an enzyme secreted 
          by the kidneys that can cause hypertension.</p>
        <p><i>It supports your immune system&...</i><br>
          Matcha contains high levels of the antioxidant known as catechins that 
          can have an anti-viral, anti-fungal anti-bacterial effect. </p>
        <p>Matcha is also rich in vitamins A and C, potassium, iron and calcium.</p>
        <p><i>Lowers your levels of LDL cholesterol (the bad one)...</i><br>
          Studies have shown that drinking up to 10 cups of green tea a day can 
          lower your bad cholesterol (LDL) levels. Instead, you could just drink 
          one cup of matcha.</p>
        <p><i>And here's why your parents should drink it too...</i><br>
          Matcha and green tea contain an antioxidant known as EGCG (epigallocatechin 
          gallate) which can studies have shown can reduce symptoms of arthritis 
          and inflammation.</p>
        <p>EGCG also helps prevent memory loss caused by the plaque deposits found 
          in the brains of people with Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p><i>How to get your daily dose?</i><br>
          You can drink matcha with hot water and mix it the traditional way using 
          a bamboo whisk. Or you can add it to your favourite milk, smoothie or 
          dessert recipe.</p>
