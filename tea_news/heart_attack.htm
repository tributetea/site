        <p align="left">DALLAS - Heavy tea drinking could reduce the risk of dying 
          after a heart attack, a study suggests.</p>
        <p align="left">The study of 1,900 heart attack victims found that those 
          who drank the most tea before their heart attacks - about 19 cups a 
          week - were 44% less likely than nondrinkers to die in the three to 
          four years afterward.</p>
        <p align="left">Moderate drinkers, or those who had fewer than 14 cups, 
          had a 28% lower death rate. The study looked at deaths from all causes, 
          not just heart disease.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;I have to say that the magnitude of the association 
          we found between tea drinking and mortality and people who survive a 
          heart attack was pretty dramatic, certainly more so than I think I would 
          have expected,&quot; said Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, assistant professor of 
          medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p align="left">The study was published in Tuesday's issue of the American 
          Heart Association journal Circulation.</p>
        <p align="left">Several studies have found that regular tea drinkers seem 
          to have a lower risk of heart attacks, though it remains unclear why.</p>
        <p align="left">Researchers involved in the latest study suspect the findings 
          are linked to flavonoids, antioxidants found naturally in various foods 
          derived from plants. Tea is a major source of flavonoids in American 
          diets.</p>
        <p align="left">&quot;We found that tea drinkers generally had lower death 
          rates regardless of age, gender, smoking status, obesity, hypertension, 
          diabetes or previous heart attack,&quot; Mukamal said.</p>
        <p align="left">Alice H. Lichtenstein, a nutrition professor at Tufts 
          University, said more research must be done before a firm relationship 
          is established between tea and heart health. She said there might be 
          other aspects of the participants' diets that could account for the 
          results.</p>
        <p align="left">The researchers acknowledged that more study is needed.</p>
