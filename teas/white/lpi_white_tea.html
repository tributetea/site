          WHITE TEA BETTER THAN OTHER TEAS<br>
          AS A POTENTIAL ANTICARCINOGEN?</font></b></font></p>
        <p align="left">&quot;White tea&quot; does not refer to black tea with 
          milk, but rather to a specific form of tea in which the leaves and buds 
          are simply steamed and dried. In this sense, white tea represents the 
          least processed form of tea, since green, oolong and black teas undergo 
          withering before various degrees of oxidation. White tea also contains 
          a higher proportion of buds, which are covered with fine 'silvery' hairs 
          that impart a light white/grey color to the tea. White tea brews to 
          a pale yellow/light red color, and has a slightly sweet flavor with 
          no 'grassy' undertones sometimes associated with green tea.<font size="1"><br>
          <br>
          </font>Researchers at the LPI tested four types of white tea for their 
          ability to inhibit mutations in bacteria, and subsequently examined 
          the protective properties in a rat colon cancer model. In the former 
          studies using bacteria, white teas were generally more effective than 
          green tea in inhibiting mutagenicity (mutagenicity is a result of unrepaired/misrepaired 
          DNA damage and an early step in the process leading to cancer). White 
          teas contained many of the expected polyphenols, some of which were 
          present at higher concentrations than in green tea brewed under the 
          same conditions. Other constituents, such as caffeine, also were present 
          at higher levels in white tea.<font size="1"><br>
          <br>
          </font> Rats were given white tea (tea was brewed for 5 min, using 2g/100ml 
          hot water) in the drinking water for up to 8 weeks. A second group was 
          given the equivalent amount of caffeine alone. In weeks 3 and 4, animals 
          were given a carcinogen from cooked meat (&quot;PhIP&quot;). After 2 
          weeks of treatment, and prior to PhIP dosing, enzyme changes were detected 
          in the liver, white tea being slightly more effective in this regard 
          than caffeine alone. Overall, the altered enzyme profiles, and profiles 
          of metabolites excreted in the urine, suggested that the carcinogen 
          was more rapidly metabolized and detoxified. At the end of the study, 
          rats given white tea had significantly fewer PhIP-induced pre-cancerous 
          lesions in the colon (called aberrant crypt foci, or ACF). However, 
          rats given caffeine alone also had fewer ACF.<font size="1"><br>
          <br>
          </font> These data are highly preliminary, and cannot be extrapolated 
          to human cancer prevention or treatment. They indicate that white tea, 
          like other forms of tea, can block the DNA damage caused by some compounds 
          using a test tube assay with bacteria as indicator organisms. The animal 
          studies scored pre-cancerous changes in the colon, not actual tumors, 
          and raised the possibility that any potential extra 'benefit' from white 
          tea (versus other teas) might simply be related to higher caffeine levels. 
          Finally, animal studies in which inhibition of colon tumor formation 
          has been demonstrated cannot be simply extrapolated to protection in 
          people. LPI researchers are now planning further studies with white 
          tea in animal models (rats, mice, trout), and in a pilot human trial.</p>
