          </font>Throughout its history, tea leaves have been enhanced by a wide 
          variety of aromatic substances. In modern tea processing, this tradition 
          continues under two major headings: &quot;scenting&quot; and &quot;flavoring&quot;. 
          (A third category -really a form of blending- involves mixing aromatic 
          material into the tea leaves, as in the case of chai, which is made 
          by mixing tea with spices.) Two of the world's most popular teas are 
          jasmine and Earl Grey - perfect examples of scenting and flavoring. 
          Jasmine teas are scented, meaning that all that is added to the tea 
          is literally scent. To do this, tea leaves are picked, processed, dried 
          and then &quot;layered&quot; with jasmine flowers, i.e. stacked in alternating 
          layers of tea leaves and jasmine flowers separated by screens. For high 
          quality teas, such as Jasmine Pearls, the flowers are changed several 
          times and the scenting process can last up to a week. (Jasmine flowers 
          are mixed in with lower quality products for show, but they only contribute 
          negatively to the flavor since jasmine flowers themselves do not have 
          a pleasant taste.) Flavored teas are a much simpler affair. In these, 
          flavor (often in the form of a liquid or oil) is added to dry tea leaves 
          to create the desired effect. In the case of Earl Grey, oil of the exotic 
          bergamot fruit is absorbed by the tea leaves, which are then dried and 
          packed to seal in the flavor.<font size="1"><br>
