        cost a few dollars in a market (above) or tens of thousands of dollars 
        at auction. Disregarding antique pots and those by famous contemporary 
        masters, the difference in the market today essentially comes down to 
        the quality of workmanship and material.<br>
        While most people probably think all Yixing teapots are hand-made, it 
        turns out, in fact, that most made in molds. To compare: a </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">worker 
        in a factory can produce up to 100 teapots a day, while, in the same time, 
        an artisan using traditional methods can make only a few (which will require 
        several additional days of work for finishing).<br>
        Mass produced teapots have only two parts (lid &amp; body) which are molded, 
        while an artist's pot typically has five (lid, body, bottom, spout and 
        handle) which are individually formed by hand and assembled into a finished 
        pot.<br>
        <font color="#999999"><i><b><font color="#666666">THINGS TO LOOK FOR:</font></b></i></font> 
        Handmade Yixing teapots are not molded or made on a wheel. The body is 
        most often made from a single piece of clay which has been pounded flat 
        to an even thickness. Inside, you should be able to see and/or feel where 
        the two ends were joined together and also where the handle was attached 
        to the body. It should also be apparent (from tooling inside and/or a 
        visible seam on the outside) that the body and bottom were made separately 
        and joined together by hand.</font><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
