          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In China a teapot can 
          cost a few dollars in a market stall (above) or tens of thousands of 
          dollars at auction. Disregarding antique pots and those by famous contemporary 
          masters, the difference in the market today essentially comes down to 
          the quality of workmanship and material.<font size="-10"><br>
          <br>
          </font>While most people assume Yixing teapots are handmade, the truth 
          is that most most are made in molds. To compare: a worker in a factory 
          can produce up to 100 teapots a day, while, in the same time, an artisan 
          using traditional methods can make only a few (which can require several 
          additional days for finishing).<font size="-10"><br>
          <br>
          </font>Mass-produced molded pots have only two parts (lid &amp; body), 
          while an artist's teapot typically has five (lid, body, bottom, spout 
          and handle) which are individually handmade and assembled into a finished 
          pot.<font size="-10"><br>
          <br>
          </font><font color="#999999"><i><b><font color="#666666">THINGS TO LOOK 
          FOR:</font></b></i></font> Handmade Yixing teapots are not molded or 
          made on a wheel. The body is most often made from a single piece of 
          clay which has been pounded flat to an even thickness. Inside, you should 
          be able to see and/or feel where the two ends were joined together and 
          also where the handle was attached to the body. It should also be apparent 
          (from tooling inside and/or a visible seam on the outside) that the 
          body and bottom were made separately and joined together by hand (rather 
          than molded from a single piece of clay).<font size="-10"><br>
          <br>
          </font>Even on handmade pots, the lid is not always entirely handmade. 
          Sometimes it is formed with the assistance of a template to achieve 
          a better match with the body. Making a lid without a template is more 
          difficult, which makes an all-handmade pot more valuable. To identify 
          a handmade lid, look at the cylindrical part that nestles in the pot 
          for the seam where it was joined to the upper part of the lid and feel 
          for slight inconsistencies of thickness, suggesting it was formed by 
          hand rather than molded.</font></p>
